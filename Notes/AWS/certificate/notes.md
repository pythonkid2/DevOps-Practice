### Cloud Computing Deployment Models

1. **Cloud-Based Deployment**: All services and applications are fully hosted on the cloud provider’s infrastructure. This model offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, as resources are managed by the provider.

2. **On-Premises Deployment**: The infrastructure is hosted within the company’s own data centers. This model offers full control and customization but requires significant upfront investment and maintenance.

3. **Hybrid Deployment**: Combines both cloud-based and on-premises models, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. It provides flexibility for companies needing to maintain some legacy systems while utilizing cloud benefits.

Each model is chosen based on factors like scalability needs, resource management preferences, and existing IT infrastructure.
