A company needs to run some of its workloads on-premises to comply with regulatory guidelines, while also utilizing the cloud for other workloads. The company requires a consistent management experience across both on-premises and cloud environments. Which AWS service or feature should the company use to meet these requirements?

A. Dedicated Hosts  
B. AWS Outposts  (right ans)
C. Availability Zones  
D. AWS Wavelength

A. A steady-state workload that requires a specific EC2 instance configuration for an extended period  
B. A workload that can be interrupted and requires the lowest possible cost  
C. An unpredictable workload that does not require a long-term commitment  
D. A workload that is expected to run for more than 1 year


The recommended use case for **Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances** is:

A company needs an AWS networking solution that can serve as a centralized gateway to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks. Which AWS service or feature will meet this requirement?

A. Gateway VPC Endpoint  
B. AWS Direct Connect  
C. AWS Transit Gateway  
D. AWS PrivateLink 


The AWS service that will meet the requirement of acting as a centralized gateway between multiple VPCs and on-premises networks is:

**C. AWS Transit Gateway**

### Explanation:
- **AWS Transit Gateway** enables customers to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub, simplifying network management and scaling.
- **Gateway VPC Endpoint** (Option A) provides private connectivity between VPCs and AWS services, not between VPCs and on-premises networks.
- **AWS Direct Connect** (Option B) is a dedicated network connection from on-premises to AWS but doesnâ€™t serve as a hub for multiple VPCs.
- **AWS PrivateLink** (Option D) allows secure access to AWS services but is not designed for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises environments in the way Transit Gateway is.

Thus, **AWS Transit Gateway** is the best solution for centralized VPC and on-premises network connectivity.
