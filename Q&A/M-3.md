# Kubernetes

https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service

#### Types of Services in Kubernetes
- **ClusterIP:** The default service type, which exposes the service internally within the cluster.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
- **LoadBalancer:**  service that helps distribute incoming network traffic across multiple backend services or pods. 
- **ExternalName:** Maps the service to a pre-defined external DNS name.

The cluster IP port number in Kubernetes is a port number that is assigned to a Service.

**Node port** range - (default 30000-32767).

To print **running pods** in Kubernetes, 
```
kubectl get pods
```
number of running pods 
```
kubectl get pods -l status=Running | wc -l
```

A **NodePort service** in Kubernetes exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port. This means that the service will be accessible by the IP of any node on that particular port. NodePort service is the most straightforward way to expose a service from the Kubernetes cluster to the outside world.

**etcd**

**etcd** is an open-source distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a cluster of machines. It's often used in distributed systems for shared configuration and service discovery. Originally developed by CoreOS, etcd is now a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, and it is widely used in modern cloud-native environments and container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

Key features of etcd include:

1. **Simple**: etcd has a simple HTTP API with JSON-formatted requests and responses. It is easy to use and integrate into applications.

2. **Secure**: etcd supports client-to-server and server-to-server communication over SSL/TLS. It also provides authentication and access control through role-based access control (RBAC).

3. **Reliable**: etcd ensures data reliability through a distributed consensus algorithm. It uses the Raft consensus algorithm to manage a highly available replicated log.

4. **Fast**: etcd is built with performance in mind. It is designed to handle a high volume of requests with low latency.

5. **Backed by a Strong Community**: As an open-source project maintained by the CNCF, etcd benefits from a strong community of developers and users who contribute to its development and support.

**kubectl**

kubectl is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.

#### Difference between Kubeproxy and Ingress

- **Kube Proxy:** A Kubernetes daemon that runs on each node and manages network rules for services.
- **Ingress:** A Kubernetes resource that allows you to expose HTTP and HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.

#### Kubelet
- Agent that runs on each node in the cluster, ensuring that containers are running in a Pod.

#### Control Plane
- Manages the Kubernetes cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and deploying containers. The control plane includes the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd.

#### API Server
- The Kubernetes API server is the front-end interface to the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes a REST API that clients can use to manage the cluster and its resources.

#### Advantages of Kubernetes

- Scalability, automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing, easy management, and efficient resource utilization.
  
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes makes it easy to scale applications up or down by adding or removing containers as needed. This can help to improve performance and reduce costs.
- **High availability**: Kubernetes automatically load balances traffic between containers and reschedules containers if a node fails. This helps to ensure that applications are always available, even if there are problems with the underlying infrastructure.
- **Improved resource utilization**: Kubernetes automatically allocates resources to containers based on their needs. This helps to improve resource utilization and reduce waste.
- **Easy deployment and updates**: Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy and update applications without downtime. This can help to improve productivity and reduce risk.
- **Portability**: Kubernetes applications can be deployed on a variety of cloud providers and on-premises. This gives you the flexibility to choose the right platform for your needs.
- **Community support**: Kubernetes has a large and active community of users and contributors. This means that there is a wealth of information and
support available to help you get started with Kubernetes and to troubleshoot problems.

_Here are some specific examples of how Kubernetes can be used to improve the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of your applications:

Scale your applications up or down based on demand. If your application experiences a sudden increase in traffic, you can easily scale it up by adding more containers. Kubernetes will automatically distribute the traffic between the containers, so that your application remains responsive. When the traffic subsides, you can scale the application back down to save costs.
Improve the reliability of your applications. Kubernetes automatically detects and replaces failed containers. This means that your applications can continue to run even if there are problems with the underlying infrastructure.
Reduce the cost of running your applications. Kubernetes can help you to reduce the cost of running your applications by optimizing resource utilization. Kubernetes will automatically allocate resources to containers based on their needs. This means that you are not wasting resources on idle containers.

# Prometheus & Grafana

#### Types of Metrics in Prometheus
- Counters, Gauges, Histograms, and Summaries.


Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that is widely used for monitoring applications and microservices. It is known for its efficient data model and powerful query language. Prometheus primarily works based on time-series data, which are stored as metrics. These metrics can be classified into several types, including:

1. **Counter**: A monotonically increasing value that resets when the process restarts. It is often used to count the number of events or occurrences, such as the number of requests served.

2. **Gauge**: A value that can go up and down. It is typically used to represent values that can fluctuate, such as current CPU usage, memory usage, or the number of items in a queue.

3. **Histogram**: A series of buckets that represent the distribution of values in a set of samples. Histograms are used to track and record the distribution of values in a stream of data, such as request durations or response sizes.

4. **Summary**: Similar to a histogram, a summary also tracks the distribution of values in a stream of data. However, it provides a more accurate representation of the distribution's quantiles over time, making it useful for tracking percentiles of request durations, for instance.

**Terraform state file**

A Terraform state file is a file that stores information about the resources that Terraform manages. It is used by Terraform to track which resources exist, their attributes, and their relationships to other resources.

Here is a short summary of the key points:
- Terraform needs to store state to track which resources exist and their attributes, to track the relationships between resources, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.
- Best practices for managing Terraform state include storing it in a remote location, backing it up regularly, using version control, and being careful when sharing it with others.

## Terraform advantages

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code. It has a number of advantages over traditional methods of managing infrastructure, including:

- **Consistency:** Terraform uses a high-level configuration language to define your infrastructure, which means that you can specify the desired state of your infrastructure in a consistent and predictable way. This helps to reduce errors and ensure that your infrastructure is always configured correctly.

- **Reusability:** You can define reusable modules in Terraform, which can be used to create and manage complex infrastructure components. This can save you time and effort, and help you to ensure that your infrastructure is consistent and well-organized.

- **Portability:** Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure on a variety of cloud providers, as well as on-premises. This gives you the flexibility to choose the right platform for your needs, without having to lock yourself into a particular vendor.

- **Collaboration:** Terraform stores its configuration in human-readable files, which makes it easy to collaborate with other engineers on your infrastructure projects. You can also use version control to track changes to your configuration and to roll back to previous versions if necessary.

**terraform verify**

The **terraform verify** command is used to validate the syntax and internal consistency of a Terraform configuration. It does this by reading the Terraform configuration and checking for errors, such as:

- Invalid resource type names or attribute names
- Invalid attribute values
- Duplicate resource definitions
- Circular resource dependencies

**provider in Terraform**

A provider in Terraform is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with a specific infrastructure platform or service. Providers are responsible for implementing the resource types and data sources that Terraform can use to manage infrastructure.

There are many different providers available, including providers for popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, as well as providers for other infrastructure platforms like Kubernetes and VMware. 


**What is lock.hcl in Terraform?**

The lock.hcl file is a dependency lock file that tracks the specific versions of Terraform providers and modules that are required to run a Terraform configuration. Terraform automatically creates and updates the lock file each time you run the terraform init command.

**Why is lock.hcl important?**

The lock file is important because it ensures that everyone who is working on a Terraform configuration is using the same versions of the providers and modules. This helps to prevent conflicts and errors.

**When should I use lock.hcl?**

You should use the lock.hcl file whenever possible, especially if you are collaborating with other people on a Terraform configuration. The lock file will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that your configuration is consistent and reproducible.
