### Kubernetes

#### Types of Services in Kubernetes
- **ClusterIP:** Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
- **LoadBalancer:** Provides an external IP address that forwards to the service.
- **ExternalName:** Maps the service to the contents of the externalName field.

#### Difference between Kubeproxy and Ingress
- **Kube Proxy:** Handles network operations for Services in the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Ingress:** Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP.

#### Kubelet
- Agent that runs on each node in the cluster, ensuring that containers are running in a Pod.

#### Control Plane
- Manages the Kubernetes cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and deploying containers.

#### API Server
- Serves the Kubernetes API using JSON over HTTP, providing access to all Kubernetes objects.

#### Advantages of Kubernetes
- Scalability, automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing, easy management, and efficient resource utilization.

### Ansible

#### Cloud vs. On-Premises DevOps
- Cloud DevOps offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, while On-Premises DevOps provides more control and security.

### Prometheus & Grafana

#### Types of Metrics in Prometheus
- Counters, Gauges, Histograms, and Summaries.

#### Prometheus and Grafana
