Here’s a **crisp, exam-friendly note for Amazon RDS Custom** (perfect for quick revision):

---

## 📌 **Amazon RDS Custom – Exam Notes**

### 1️⃣ **What (Definition)**

Amazon **RDS Custom** = Managed database service for applications that require **custom OS/DB configuration** that standard RDS does not allow.
Think of it as: **"RDS + Root Access"** (but still managed by AWS).

---

### 2️⃣ **Why (Use Cases)**

* **Legacy/Custom apps** needing special OS configs, agents, or database patches.
* **Vendor apps** (ERP, CRM) that require custom DB settings.
* Need **SSH access** to database host for troubleshooting or installing software.
* Need to control DB and OS patching schedule but still want automated backups, monitoring.

---

### 3️⃣ **How (Configuration)**

* Choose **RDS Custom for Oracle or SQL Server** (supported engines as of now).
* AWS provisions an EC2 instance under the hood with DB pre-installed.
* You get **SSH access** + **OS-level customization** ability.
* Can still use:

  * Automated backups
  * Monitoring (CloudWatch)
  * Read replicas (where supported)
* Responsibility split:

  * **AWS**: infrastructure, automated backups, storage, failover.
  * **You**: OS-level changes, DB patching, security hardening.

---

### 4️⃣ **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* More expensive than normal RDS (since you manage more control).
* Misconfigurations can break automation (backups, monitoring) – you are responsible.
* No full hands-off like RDS Standard.
* Supported only for **Oracle & SQL Server** (as of exam).
* Root access means you must be careful with changes — AWS automation can pause if instance is misconfigured.

---

### 5️⃣ **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* **"Need OS-level or DB-level customization" → RDS Custom**
* **"Need SSH access to DB host" → RDS Custom**
* **"Legacy apps requiring special agents / patches" → RDS Custom**
* **"Fully managed, no customization" → RDS (Standard)**

Think of it as **"Managed EC2 DB"** vs. "Fully-managed RDS".

---

Here’s a **crisp, exam-friendly note** for **Migrating RDS MySQL → Aurora MySQL + Aurora Replicas + Auto Scaling** (perfect for quick revision):

---

## 📌 **Amazon Aurora Migration & Replica Notes (Exam Focus)**

### 1️⃣ **Migration: RDS MySQL → Aurora MySQL**

* **Use AWS DMS (Database Migration Service)** or **Snapshot Restore**:

  * Take snapshot of RDS MySQL → Restore snapshot as Aurora MySQL cluster.
  * Minimal downtime migration (DMS for near-zero downtime).
* After migration, **update application endpoints** to point to Aurora cluster writer endpoint.

---

### 2️⃣ **Aurora Architecture & Benefits**

* **Distributed, fault-tolerant storage** (decoupled from compute).
* **Auto-scales storage** up to **128 TiB** per database.
* Data replicated across **3 AZs** (6 copies total).
* **Continuous backup to S3**, point-in-time recovery.
* **Faster failover** (30 seconds or less typically).
* **Higher throughput** vs MySQL (up to 5x faster).

---

### 3️⃣ **Aurora Replicas vs MySQL Read Replicas**

| Feature          | MySQL Read Replica          | Aurora Replica               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Replication Type | Asynchronous                | Synchronous (shared storage) |
| Replica Lag      | Seconds (sometimes minutes) | \~10s of milliseconds        |
| Max Replicas     | 5                           | 15                           |
| Failover         | Manual or semi-auto         | Automated failover possible  |
| Storage          | Separate copy               | Shared storage volume        |

✅ **Exam Keyword:** "Need <1 second replication lag / near real-time reads" → **Aurora Replicas**

---

### 4️⃣ **Aurora Auto Scaling**

* **Aurora Replicas** can scale up/down automatically based on:

  * **CPU utilization**
  * **Connections**
  * **Average replica lag**
* **Aurora Auto Scaling = Add/Remove replicas automatically**
* Helps handle sudden read workload spikes cost-effectively.

---

### 5️⃣ **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* **"Minimal replica lag"** → Aurora Replica (shared storage).
* **"Auto scale read replicas"** → Aurora Auto Scaling.
* **"Cross-AZ replication + continuous backup + 15 replicas"** → Aurora.
* **"Migrate MySQL to Aurora with minimal downtime"** → DMS or snapshot restore.

---

### 🧠 **Memory Hook (For Exam)**

**AURORA = A-U-R-O-R-A**

* **A**uto-scaling
* **U**ltra-fast replication (ms lag)
* **R**eplicas up to 15
* **O**ptimized storage (128 TiB, 3 AZs)
* **R**ecovery (PITR + S3 backup)
* **A**vailability (HA, self-healing)

Here’s a **crisp, exam-focused note for AWS DataSync** for quick revision:

---

## 📌 **AWS DataSync – Exam Notes**

### 1️⃣ **What (Definition)**

AWS **DataSync** = **Online data transfer service** for moving large amounts of data quickly **to, from, and between** AWS storage services.

* Fully managed
* 10x faster than open-source tools (rsync)
* Secure, automated, scalable

---

### 2️⃣ **Why (Use Cases)**

* **Migrate on-premises data → AWS** (S3, EFS, FSx)
* **Replicate data between AWS storage services** (S3 <-> EFS, FSx <-> FSx)
* **Disaster recovery**: Continuous sync between on-prem and AWS
* **Big data processing**: Quickly load datasets into AWS

---

### 3️⃣ **How (Configuration)**

* Deploy a **DataSync Agent** on-premises (VMware, Hyper-V, KVM).
* Define **Source Location** (on-prem NFS/SMB, AWS service).
* Define **Destination Location** (S3, EFS, FSx, etc.).
* Create **Tasks** → schedule for one-time or recurring transfers.
* Supports **encryption (TLS), data integrity checks, and IAM** for permissions.

---

### 4️⃣ **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* **Agent required** for on-premises sources (not needed for cloud-to-cloud).
* Transfers only **file data** (not block storage snapshots).
* Pricing based on **data transferred (per GB)**.

---

### 5️⃣ **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* **"Fast, secure, automated online data transfer" → DataSync**
* **"10x faster than open-source" → DataSync**
* **"Agent for on-prem" → DataSync**
* **"Move data between S3, EFS, FSx" → DataSync**
* **"Recurring scheduled sync" → DataSync**

---

### 🧠 **Memory Hook**

**DATASYNC = "DATA SPEED SYNC"**

* **D** – Data transfer
* **A** – Automated
* **T** – Task-based
* **A** – Agent (on-prem)
* **S** – Secure (TLS)
* **Y** – Your storage (S3/EFS/FSx)
* **N** – Near real-time sync
* **C** – Cloud migration

---

VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3 = creates a private route from your VPC to S3 over the AWS network (no NAT required, no public IPs required, no extra data processing charges)

App Runner → “I just want my container to run, scale, and serve traffic — no cluster headaches.”
EKS → “I need full control, multiple microservices, custom networking, CI/CD integration, service mesh, and Kubernetes portability.”
+++++++++
Inbound endpoint = allows on-prem DNS servers to send queries into Route 53 Resolver (so VPC names can be resolved by on-prem resolvers by forwarding queries to the inbound endpoint).

Outbound endpoint = lets Route 53 Resolver forward queries out to your on-prem DNS servers (so resources in the VPC can resolve on-prem names by conditional forwarding through the outbound endpoint).
++

**CloudFormation StackSets** -extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.

<img width="739" height="414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a91f1edf-bf47-4186-afc6-3e661a77a05f" />

**AWS CloudFormation template** - JSON or YAML-format, text-based file that describes all the AWS resources you need to deploy to run your application.

- blueprint for a stack

 **CloudFormation stacks** stack is a set of AWS resources that are created and managed as a single unit when AWS CloudFormation instantiates a template
    -  A stack cannot be used to deploy the same template across AWS accounts and regions

**AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM)** AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any AWS account or within your AWS Organization.


 **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**

 provides the information required to launch an instance.

contains - One or more Amazon EBS snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance.

You can copy an AMI within or across AWS Regions using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface or SDKs, or the Amazon EC2 API, all of which support the CopyImage action. You can copy both Amazon EBS-backed AMIs and instance-store-backed AMIs. You can copy AMIs with encrypted snapshots and also change encryption status during the copy process.


<img width="1428" height="928" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44ae91f4-1a23-4780-b5d1-7a343577ff2b" />

Think resource performance monitoring, events, and alerts; think **Amazon CloudWatch**.

Think account-specific activity and audit; think **AWS CloudTrail**.

Think resource-specific history, audit, and compliance; think **AWS Config**.

Global users + low-latency + UDP/TCP traffic = **AWS Global Accelerator**

Single-region + UDP/TCP traffic = **NLB**

HTTP/HTTPS traffic with Layer 7 features = **ALB**


**Amazon API Gateway HTTP APIs support native JWT authorizers**

Perfect ✅ — this is another exam favorite. Let’s break down **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume types**, their use cases, and when to choose each one.

---

# 📌 **Amazon EBS Volume Types – Exam Cheat Sheet**

EBS volumes are **block storage** for EC2 — persistent, resizable, and AZ-specific.

---

## 1️⃣ **General Purpose SSD (gp2 / gp3)**

* **gp2** – legacy, performance scales with size
* **gp3** – latest generation, performance configurable independent of size
* **Performance:**

  * gp3 baseline: **3,000 IOPS + 125 MB/s throughput** (configurable up to 16,000 IOPS & 1,000 MB/s)
  * gp2: 3 IOPS per GB (max 16,000 IOPS)
* **Use When:**

  * ✅ Boot volumes
  * ✅ Small to medium DBs
  * ✅ Dev/Test environments
  * ✅ General-purpose workloads

**Exam Keyword:** "Most workloads" → **gp3 (preferred)**

---

## 2️⃣ **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 / io2)**

* **Performance:**

  * io1/io2: Up to **64,000 IOPS** per volume
  * io2: Higher durability (99.999%)
* **Supports Multi-Attach** (attach to multiple EC2 instances at once, same AZ)
* **Use When:**

  * ✅ Mission-critical databases (Oracle, SQL, SAP HANA, etc.)
  * ✅ High-transaction, low-latency workloads
  * ✅ Need predictable performance regardless of size

**Exam Keyword:** "High-performance DB" → **io2**
**Exam Keyword:** "Multi-Attach required" → **io1/io2 only**

---

## 3️⃣ **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**

* **Performance:**

  * Throughput-based (not IOPS)
  * Max throughput: \~500 MB/s
* **Use When:**

  * ✅ Big data analytics
  * ✅ Streaming workloads
  * ✅ Log processing
  * ✅ Large sequential workloads

**Exam Keyword:** "Big data, large sequential I/O" → **st1**

---

## 4️⃣ **Cold HDD (sc1)**

* **Performance:**

  * Lowest cost
  * Max throughput: \~250 MB/s
* **Use When:**

  * ✅ Infrequently accessed data
  * ✅ Lowest-cost storage needed
  * ✅ Archive data you still want online

**Exam Keyword:** "Lowest cost magnetic, rarely accessed" → **sc1**

---

## 🧠 **Memory Hook**

Think of **EBS Volumes as Ladders of Performance vs Cost:**

🔼 **Cost ↑, Performance ↑**
`sc1 (cold) → st1 (throughput) → gp3 (general) → io2 (high IOPS)`

---

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls / Exam Gotchas**

* ❌ **gp2 performance scales with size** → gp3 allows you to decouple size and performance.
* ❌ HDD volumes (st1, sc1) **cannot be boot volumes**.
* ❌ Multi-Attach is **only supported for io1/io2**, not gp3.
* ❌ Choose io2 for **business-critical DBs** (better durability than io1).

## 🧠 **Memory Hook**

* **gp3 = Go-to volume (Default)**
* **io2 = IOPS King (Databases)**
* **st1 = Streaming / Sequential**
* **sc1 = Cold Storage**

---

## 📝 **Exam Quick Hits**

* ❌ **HDD volumes (st1, sc1) cannot be boot volumes.**
* ✅ **io1/io2 only** support Multi-Attach.
* ✅ Use **gp3** unless you have a clear need for higher IOPS/throughput or lower cost for sequential data.
* ✅ Choose **io2** for **critical DBs** because of its higher durability (99.999%).

# 📑 **Route 53 Routing Policies – When to Use**

| **Policy**          | **When to Use (Scenario)**                                                                                           | **Key Notes / Exam Keywords**                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Failover** 🛑     | When you need **Active-Passive High Availability**. Route to secondary only if primary fails.                        | 📌 *Primary-Secondary*, Health Check required, **DR/HA** |
| **Simple** 🔑       | When you have **a single resource** (no special routing) or just want to return multiple values randomly.            | 📌 *Default*, No health check by default                 |
| **Weighted** ⚖️     | When you want to **split traffic by percentage** — A/B testing, gradual migration, canary deployment.                | 📌 *Traffic Split, Controlled Migration*                 |
| **Latency-based** ⚡ | When you want users to connect to **lowest latency endpoint** (multi-region setups).                                 | 📌 *Low Latency, Geo-Spread Workload*                    |
| **Geolocation** 🌍  | When you want to route based on **user’s country/continent** for compliance, language, or pricing reasons.           | 📌 *Country-Based Routing*                               |
| **Geoproximity** 📍 | When you want to route based on **geographic location AND bias traffic toward a specific region** (shift % traffic). | 📌 *Traffic Bias, Gradual Shift*                         |
| **Multi-Value** ✅   | When you want **DNS-based load balancing** — return multiple healthy records (simple + health checks).               | 📌 *DNS Load Balancing, Health Check*                    |

---

# 🎯 **Failover – When to Use**

* ✅ **Critical application** where downtime is not acceptable
* ✅ You have a **primary active site** and a **backup DR site** (warm/cold standby)
* ✅ You want **automatic switch** to backup on health check failure

---

# 📝 **Exam Quick Tip**

> ❗ **Remember:**
>
> * *Failover → Active/Passive HA*
> * *Weighted → % Traffic Split (Testing)*
> * *Latency → Performance*
> * *Geo/Geoproximity → Location-based control*
> * *Multi-Value → DNS-level LB + Health Check*

Great question! 👌
If you need to connect **on-premises network ↔ AWS**, Site-to-Site VPN is just **one option**.
Here’s a **complete list of connectivity options** with **when to use which** — very important for exam questions.

---

# 🌐 **AWS On-Prem to VPC Connectivity Options**

| **Option**                           | **What It Is**                                                              | **When to Use (Best Fit)**                                                                                   | **Pros**                                           | **Cons**                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site-to-Site VPN** 🔑              | IPSec VPN over the internet (VGW + CGW).                                    | Quick, low-cost, encrypted connection between on-prem and AWS. Good for small/medium workloads, testing, DR. | Fast to deploy, 2 tunnels for HA, managed by AWS.  | Internet-dependent (latency + jitter), bandwidth not guaranteed.       |
| **AWS Direct Connect (DX)** ⚡        | Dedicated physical fiber connection to AWS (1 Gbps / 10 Gbps link).         | High-throughput, low-latency workloads (e.g. financial apps, large data transfer).                           | Consistent network, private, reliable, SLAs.       | Setup time (weeks), higher cost.                                       |
| **Direct Connect + VPN (Hybrid)** 🔀 | DX for primary traffic + VPN as backup (failover).                          | Mission-critical workloads needing redundancy + compliance.                                                  | Combines reliability of DX with HA of VPN.         | Higher cost + more configuration.                                      |
| **Transit Gateway + VPN/DX** 🛜      | Hub-and-spoke network connecting multiple VPCs + on-prem sites.             | Large-scale multi-VPC + hybrid cloud architecture.                                                           | Centralized routing, scales to thousands of VPCs.  | More expensive than a single VGW.                                      |
| **VPC Peering** 🔗                   | Private connection between two VPCs (same/different accounts/regions).      | Connect VPCs when only a few are needed, no transitive routing needed.                                       | Simple, no bandwidth bottleneck, no VPN.           | No transitive routing (must peer each pair), no central mgmt.          |
| **AWS PrivateLink** 🔒               | Private connectivity to AWS services or third-party SaaS over AWS backbone. | Secure access to services without exposing them to the internet.                                             | No public IP, highly secure.                       | Only works for NLBs / interface endpoints (not full VPC connectivity). |
| **Client VPN** 👤                    | OpenVPN-based solution for individual users (not whole site).               | Secure access for remote workforce (laptops, WFH).                                                           | Managed, scales automatically, no hardware needed. | Not for site-to-site; per-user cost model.                             |

Would you like me to make a **side-by-side decision matrix** (flowchart style) that says "If you need X → use Y" for all these options (super helpful for last-minute exam revision)?


Got it ✅ — let's make a **clear, exam-focused short note** for **AWS Site-to-Site VPN** (with What / Why / How / Pitfalls / Exam Tips).

---

# 🧾 **AWS Site-to-Site VPN – Exam Notes**

## 1️⃣ **What**

AWS **Site-to-Site VPN** creates a **secure, encrypted IPsec tunnel** between your **on-premises network** (or another cloud) and your **Amazon VPC**.
It allows your on-prem servers to communicate privately with AWS resources as if they were in the same network.

---

## 2️⃣ **Why (Use Cases)**

✅ Extend your data center or office network securely into AWS
✅ Hybrid cloud architecture (on-prem + VPC)
✅ Backup/DR connectivity (with or without Direct Connect)
✅ Low-cost, quick setup compared to Direct Connect
✅ Temporary secure connection for migration

---

## 3️⃣ **How (Setup)**

1. **Create a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**

   * Attach it to your VPC (acts as AWS end of VPN).
2. **Create a Customer Gateway (CGW)**

   * Represents your on-prem router / firewall (public IP + ASN if BGP).
3. **Create the Site-to-Site VPN connection**

   * Select VGW + CGW, enable **static routing** or **BGP (dynamic routing)**.
4. **Download configuration**

   * Apply to your on-prem router/firewall (supports most vendors: Cisco, Juniper, Fortinet).
5. **Test connectivity**

   * Optionally create a **VPN CloudWatch alarm** for tunnel status.

---

## 4️⃣ **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

⚠️ **Single VGW limit** per VPC (use Transit Gateway for many VPNs).
⚠️ **2 VPN tunnels per connection** (for redundancy, always configure both).
⚠️ Bandwidth limited by internet and VPN encryption overhead (\~1.25 Gbps per tunnel, not guaranteed).
⚠️ Latency depends on public internet — not suitable for low-latency workloads.
⚠️ Customer router must support IPsec & IKEv1/IKEv2.

---

## 5️⃣ **Exam Tips / Keywords**

📌 **VGW** = AWS side endpoint
📌 **CGW** = On-prem side endpoint
📌 **BGP** = Recommended (dynamic routes, failover handled automatically)
📌 **2 tunnels** = HA by default
📌 **Transit Gateway + VPN** = Scale to many VPCs
📌 Often paired with **Direct Connect** for hybrid cloud redundancy (DX + VPN → **AWS Direct Connect + VPN failover** pattern)

# 📦 **Amazon S3 Storage Classes – Minimum Retention Periods**

Not all S3 classes have a minimum retention/charge duration. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### ✅ **No Minimum Retention Period**

* **S3 Standard**
* **S3 Intelligent-Tiering (frequent access tier)**
* **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**
  👉 You pay only for what you use, no penalties for deleting objects early.

---

### ⏱️ **Minimum Retention / Charge Period Applies**

* **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** → **30 days**
* **S3 One Zone-IA** → **30 days**
* **S3 Intelligent-Tiering (infrequent + archive tiers)** → **30 days**
* **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** → **90 days**
* **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** → **180 days**

---

### 📌 **Exam Tip**

* If you see **"delete object before X days → still charged"**, that’s **IA or Glacier classes**.
* **S3 Standard has *no* minimum retention period.**

---

✅ So, to your question:
**No, S3 Standard does not have a minimum retention period.**

---
Perfect 👍 here’s your **exam-focused S3 Storage Classes Cheat Sheet** – with **retention, retrieval, and when to use what**.

---

# 📝 **Exam Shortcuts**

* **No min retention** → Standard, Intelligent-Tiering (frequent), Glacier Instant.
* **30-day min** → Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Intelligent-Tiering (IA tiers).
* **90-day min** → Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
* **180-day min** → Glacier Deep Archive.
* **Single AZ storage** → One Zone-IA (NOT Standard).
* **Lowest latency archive** → Glacier Instant Retrieval.
* **Cheapest archival** → Glacier Deep Archive.

---

✅ This is the **exact pattern AWS exam questions use**:

* “Object deleted after 10 days but still charged” → IA (30 days).
* “Cheapest, long-term compliance storage” → Deep Archive (180 days).
* “Archive but need milliseconds retrieval” → Glacier Instant Retrieval.

 - There are no S3 data transfer charges when data is transferred in from the internet. Also with S3TA, you pay only for transfers that are accelerated.

Great question 👌 This one trips up many people in **AWS Solution Architect exams**. Let’s carefully break it down.

---

## **The Scenario**

* You have an **AWS VPC** (with your web portal).
* You have **on-premises legacy systems** connected via **Site-to-Site VPN**.
* You want **apps inside the VPC** to resolve **private DNS names** hosted **on-premises**.
* You are using **Amazon Route 53 as DNS**.

---

## **How DNS Normally Works**

* In AWS, **EC2 instances in a VPC** by default use the **AmazonProvidedDNS** resolver (inside VPC).
* But that resolver **only knows about AWS-hosted domains** (public + Route 53 Private Hosted Zones).
* It **cannot resolve on-premises DNS records** (like `db.legacy.local`).

So we need a way to forward DNS queries from AWS → On-premises DNS servers.

---

## **Route 53 Resolver**

Think of it as a **DNS bridge** between AWS and on-prem DNS.
It has two types of endpoints:

1. **Outbound Endpoint**

   * Allows **DNS queries from VPC → On-prem DNS servers**.
   * You set **forwarding rules**:

     * Example: “If domain ends with `.corp.local`, send query to on-prem DNS server (IP 10.0.0.5)”.
   * This is what we need in your case.

2. **Inbound Endpoint**

   * Allows **on-premises servers → Resolve AWS private DNS zones**.
   * Used if your on-prem clients need to resolve AWS-hosted records.

---

## **Correct Answer Explanation**

> **Create a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint. Define a forwarding rule that routes DNS queries for on-premises domains to the on-premises DNS server. Associate the rule with the VPC.**

* Outbound endpoint = lets AWS VPC send queries **out** to on-prem.
* Forwarding rule = tells AWS resolver *which domains* should go to on-prem DNS.
* Association = attach the rule to your VPC so EC2s in that VPC benefit.

So when your AWS app queries `db.legacy.local`:

1. EC2 asks the VPC DNS.
2. Rule matches → forwards to outbound endpoint → sends to on-prem DNS via VPN.
3. On-prem DNS replies → back through the VPN → outbound endpoint → to your EC2.

✅ Secure (because it goes through VPN).
✅ Correct way to integrate AWS + on-prem DNS.

---

## **Why Other Options Are Wrong**

* **Inbound endpoint**: used when *on-prem* needs to resolve AWS, not the other way around.
* **Hybrid connectivity gateway**: not an AWS service for DNS.
* **Private hosted zone**: would require duplicating your on-prem DNS records in AWS → not scalable and not authoritative.

---

📌 **Exam Tip**:

* If **VPC → On-prem DNS** → **Outbound Endpoint**.
* If **On-prem → VPC DNS** → **Inbound Endpoint**.

Short answer: **No—DataSync isn’t only for NFS→EFS.** It’s the **managed way to move/sync files at scale** between on-prem and AWS, and also **within AWS**.

# DataSync — 60-sec Cheat Sheet

**What it moves (sources/dests):**

* **On-prem:** NFS, **SMB**, **HDFS**, S3-compatible object storage
* **AWS:** **S3**, **EFS**, **FSx** (Windows/SMB, Lustre, OpenZFS, NetApp ONTAP)

**Where it runs / network:**

* Agent runs on-prem VM/host (or EC2); transfers **over Internet, VPN, or Direct Connect**; can use **VPC endpoints/PrivateLink** to keep traffic private.

**Top use cases (beyond NFS→EFS):**

* **NFS/SMB → S3** (backups, analytics landing zone)
* **S3 ↔ FSx for Lustre** (HPC pipelines)
* **SMB ↔ FSx for Windows** (lift-and-shift Windows shares)
* **EFS ↔ EFS** (inter-Region/project migrations)
* **S3 ↔ S3** (cross-account/Region bulk copy with verification)
* **HDFS → S3** (off Hadoop → data lake)

**Why choose it (exam keywords):**

* **Managed, parallel, incremental**, **verification (checksum)**
* **Schedules**, include/exclude filters, **bandwidth throttle**
* Preserves file **metadata/permissions** (POSIX/SMB)
* **CloudWatch metrics** + **task reports**; retries & resumable

**When NOT to pick DataSync (pick these instead):**

* **Databases** → **AWS DMS**
* **Continuous low-latency hybrid access** → **Storage Gateway (File/Volume/Tape)**
* **End-user SFTP/FTPS/FTP** → **AWS Transfer Family**
* **S3→S3 ongoing object replication** → **S3 Replication**
* **Streaming events/logs** → **Kinesis / MSK**
* **Huge offline bulk (no network)** → **Snowball/Snowmobile**

**Memory hook:** **“M3V-S”** → **M**igrate **M**illions of files, **M**anaged, **V**erified, **V**PC-private, **S**cheduled.
