**Load Balancing** - Is the capability to distribute the traffic among multiple instances according to some algorithms (e.g., round robin).

**Service Discovery** - 
- Whenever a new instance comes up, the system should be aware of it and connect to it.
- Whenever an existing system crashes, the system should be informed to stop forwarding requests to it.


# Kubernetes

- Automatic Failover: Kubernetes provides automated failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and minimize downtime in case of node failures.

- Communication between two containers (across different machines):
  - Service Discovery, Load Balancing: 
- Automatic Bin Packing and Scheduling: Kubernetes automatically schedules containers based on resource requirements and constraints, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimal performance.

- Automatic Scaling:
  - Scale-out/Scale-in: Kubernetes enables automatic scaling of applications based on predefined metrics, allowing for seamless horizontal scaling by adding or removing instances to meet the demands of the workload dynamically.
