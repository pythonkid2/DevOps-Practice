The AWS infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones (AZs). An AWS Region is a physical location in the world which has multiple Availability Zones ( AZs). These Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Each Region is completely independent. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links.


Edge locations that are separate from Regions and are located at other locations. These Edge locations allow you to push your content near to your customers to give them a better experience on your platform.
