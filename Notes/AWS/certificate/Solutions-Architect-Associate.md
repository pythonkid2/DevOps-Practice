## ElasticBeanstalk

## ✅ **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)**

### 1. **What**

> AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that lets you **deploy, manage, and scale web applications** and services without managing the underlying infrastructure (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, etc.).

---

### 2. **Why (Use Cases)**

* Quickly deploy **web apps** using languages like Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Node.js, Go, Ruby, or Docker.
* Ideal for teams that want **managed infrastructure** with minimal setup.
* Auto handles **scaling, load balancing, health monitoring**, and patching.
* Supports **zero-downtime deployments** and easy rollbacks.

---

### 3. **How (Configuration)**

* Package your app (ZIP or WAR).
* Go to **Elastic Beanstalk Console** or use **EB CLI**.
* Create an **Environment**:

  * Choose platform (e.g., Python, Node.js).
  * Choose **Web server environment** (for HTTP apps) or **Worker environment** (for background jobs).
* EB automatically provisions:

  * **EC2 instances**
  * **Auto Scaling Group**
  * **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
  * **CloudWatch alarms**
  * Optional: **RDS** DB instances

> You can customize environments using:

* `.ebextensions/` for config files
* Saved configurations
* Custom AMIs

---

### 4. **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* **Long boot time** if app installation is heavy → use **custom AMI** to preinstall.
* Limited control over low-level infrastructure (vs EC2 or ECS).
* Rolling deployments can **terminate old instances** → configure appropriately.
* No fine-grained IAM per container/app like in ECS/EKS.
* RDS lifecycle is **tied to environment** unless created separately.

---

### 5. **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* “**Quickly deploy web apps**” → Elastic Beanstalk
* “**Manage app without infra**” → EB
* “**Takes 45 mins to start, want 2 mins**” → Use **Custom AMI + Saved Configuration**
* Often compared with:

  * **OpsWorks** (Chef/Puppet config)
  * **CloudFormation** (infra as code)
  * **CodeDeploy** (custom deployments)
* “Fully managed service for deployment” → EB
