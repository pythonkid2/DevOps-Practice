# SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND

> **Document format:** Each question has a **Senior Answer**, **Important Points**, and **Likely Follow-Ups**. No raw mock transcripts — customize with your HHS experience when practicing.

---

## 1. Please introduce yourself and explain your current role and responsibilities.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "Good morning. I'm **Mathew Joseph**, a **DevOps Engineer** with **six years of experience** building secure and scalable infrastructure on **Azure and AWS**, with my primary focus on **Microsoft Azure**.
>
> In my role at **HHS**, I worked on a **healthcare platform for US state government clients** — **Florida, Iowa, and South Dakota**. I owned **end-to-end infrastructure**: provisioning cloud resources, deploying applications on **AKS**, and **day-to-day Kubernetes cluster operations** — including upgrades, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
>
> My responsibilities fall into four areas:
> - **Platform & Kubernetes:** AKS cluster maintenance, node pool updates, ingress, and workload deployments
> - **CI/CD & Automation:** Pipelines for **30+ microservices** in Azure DevOps and Jenkins — including automated tasks like **restoring non-production Postgres data** from production to dev/stage environments on demand
> - **Operations:** Incident response, cluster health monitoring, and fast troubleshooting during production issues
> - **Security & Compliance:** Government healthcare compliance requirements and secure pipeline practices
>
> I hold **AZ-900** and **AWS Solutions Architect** certifications. I'm looking to bring my hands-on **AKS and Azure DevOps** experience into a role where I can own **platform reliability at scale**.
>
> Thank you."



---

## 2. How many years of experience do you have in Azure and DevOps?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "I have **six years of experience** in **DevOps and cloud engineering**, working across both **Azure and AWS**.
>
> **Azure:** Approximately **four years** of hands-on experience — including VMs, VNets, NSGs, Application Gateway, **AKS**, **ACR**, and **Azure DevOps** pipelines. At **HHS**, my recent production work has been **primarily on Azure** — deploying and operating **30+ microservices** on AKS using Azure DevOps for CI/CD.
>
> **AWS:** I also have solid AWS exposure from earlier projects — EC2, S3, IAM, and pipeline integrations — which helps when working in multi-cloud environments.
>
> **My growth path:**
> - **Early years:** Git, Jenkins, basic cloud VMs, CI/CD fundamentals
> - **Mid years:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, containerization with Docker
> - **Recent years:** Deep Azure focus — AKS cluster operations, Azure DevOps repos and pipelines, RBAC for team access, and government healthcare compliance
>
> So while I'm comfortable on both clouds, my **deepest recent production experience is on Azure** — especially AKS, Azure DevOps, and day-to-day platform operations. I'm fully comfortable owning infrastructure through deployment and production support."

## 3. Describe your recent project architecture.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "My recent project at **HHS** is a **healthcare platform for US state governments** — Florida, Iowa, South Dakota — running **30+ microservices** on **Azure**.
>
> **1. Infrastructure (IaC):** Everything is provisioned with **Terraform** — VNet, subnets, AKS, ACR, Application Gateway, Front Door, Key Vault, and supporting resources.
>
> **2. Networking:** We use a **VNet** with **private subnets**. **AKS** runs on **private nodes** — no direct public exposure. **Azure Front Door** is the global entry point, then traffic flows to **Application Gateway (WAF)**, which routes to the cluster via the **Ingress Controller (AGIC)**.
>
> **3. Traffic flow:**
> ```
> User (Browser)
>   → Azure DNS
>   → Azure Front Door (CDN/WAF/global routing)
>   → Application Gateway (WAF, SSL termination)
>   → Ingress Controller (inside AKS)
>   → Kubernetes Services
>   → Pods (30+ microservices)
>   → PostgreSQL (operational DB)
> ```
>
> **4. CI/CD (Azure DevOps):** On pipeline trigger → code passes **DevSecOps checks** → Docker image built and pushed to **ACR** → deployed to AKS via Helm/kubectl. Secrets come from **Azure Key Vault** using **service connections** and **Managed Identity** — never stored in code.
>
> **5. Monitoring:** **Prometheus + Grafana** inside the cluster for metrics; logs and operational DB monitoring for health and troubleshooting.
>
> **6. DR/Backup:** VM snapshots, **Azure Backup**, and **Site Recovery** for critical components.
>
> Environments: **Dev → Stage → Production** with separate namespaces/subscriptions and promotion via Azure DevOps pipelines."

## 4. Which Azure services have you worked on extensively?


---

## 5. Have you managed Azure VMs, Storage Accounts, and Backup services?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "Yes, I have managed all three extensively — especially in our **early VM-based phase** before we moved to AKS.
>
> **Azure VMs:**
> - Hosted applications directly on VMs and **self-hosted GitLab** on a dedicated VM
> - Ran **Docker workloads** on VMs before containerizing to AKS
> - Built **Azure Functions** to **automatically shut down dev/test VMs during off-peak hours** (nights/weekends) for **cost savings**
> - Connected via **Azure Bastion** — no public RDP/SSH
>
> **Backup & Snapshots:**
> - Configured **daily VM backups** via **Azure Backup** — e.g., GitLab VM backed up daily after business hours
> - Took **disk snapshots** before changes and for restore drills
> - Stored backups in **Recovery Services Vault** with defined retention
>
> **Storage Accounts:**
> - Used **Azure Blob Storage** for application data and file storage
> - Stored **Terraform remote state** in Azure Blob — team-shared, version-controlled infrastructure
> - Configured appropriate access with **RBAC** and private access where needed
>
> So yes — full lifecycle: **provision VMs → backup/snapshot → cost optimize → migrate to AKS** when ready."


---

## 6. Have you configured Disaster Recovery or Azure Backup?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "Yes — I've configured both **Azure Backup** and **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**, plus **AKS-specific backup** with Velero.
>
> **Azure Backup (VMs & Disks):**
> - **Point-in-time restore** with scheduled backup policies
> - **Retention:** typically **30–90 days** based on compliance and RPO requirements
> - **Frequency:** weekly by default; **daily or hourly** for high-change or critical workloads
> - Stored in **Recovery Services Vault** (Microsoft-managed — not a Storage Account we pick)
> - Used for VMs (e.g., self-hosted GitLab) and **managed disk backups** for StatefulSet PVs
>
> **Azure Site Recovery (DR):**
> - **Replicates VMs** from primary region to secondary region
> - On disaster → **test failover or committed failover** → services continue in DR region
> - Combined with **Azure Front Door / DNS** cutover for traffic routing
>
> **AKS Backup (Velero):**
> - **Namespace-level incremental backups** — twice weekly
> - Backup storage in **Azure Blob Storage**
> - Can **restore namespaces to same or another region**
> - **PV/PVC (StatefulSets):** disk-level backup via **Azure Backup** on underlying managed disks
>
> **Key Vault:** Yes — Key Vault supports **backup and restore** of secrets, keys, and certificates (`az keyvault backup`). We also enable **soft delete** and **purge protection** for compliance.
>
> **Full DR strategy:** **Terraform** recreates infrastructure in DR region → restore **Velero** (K8s resources) from Blob → restore **disks/VMs** from Azure Backup → **ASR failover** for replicated VMs → DNS/Front Door cutover."


---

## 7. Have you created or managed AKS clusters?


---

## 8. What are Pods, Deployments, Services, and Namespaces?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> - **Pod:** Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. One or more containers sharing network and storage. **Ephemeral** — if it dies, Kubernetes creates a new one.
>
> - **Deployment:** Controller that manages pod **replicas**, **rolling updates**, and **rollbacks**. You declare desired state (e.g., 3 replicas); Deployment keeps it.
>
> - **Service:** Stable **network endpoint** for pods (which have changing IPs). Routes traffic via **label selectors**. Types:
>   - **ClusterIP** — internal only (most common)
>   - **NodePort** — exposes on node port
>   - **LoadBalancer** — external access via cloud LB (e.g., Azure Load Balancer)
>
> - **Namespace:** **Logical isolation** within a cluster — separate dev/staging/prod, RBAC, quotas, and network policies.
>
> **One-liner:** *Pod runs containers → Deployment manages pods → Service gives stable address → Namespace isolates workloads.*
>
> **Bonus (if asked):** **StatefulSet** for stateful apps like databases — stable pod names (pod-0, pod-1), ordered deployment, and **PersistentVolumes** for storage."


---

## 9. Which CI/CD tools have you used?


---

## 10. Explain your deployment process from Dev to Production.


---

## 11. What are VNets and NSGs?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **VNet (Virtual Network):** A **private, logically isolated network** in Azure. You define an **IP address range (CIDR)** — e.g., `10.0.0.0/16` — and divide it into **subnets**. Resources like **AKS nodes, VMs, and Application Gateway** get private IPs from these subnets. VNets can **peer** with other VNets and connect on-premises via VPN/ExpressRoute.
>
> **NSG (Network Security Group):** A **firewall rule set** that controls **inbound and outbound traffic**. Attached to a **subnet** or **network interface (NIC)**. Rules define source/destination IP, port, protocol, and **allow/deny** — evaluated by priority. Example: allow 443 from App Gateway subnet; deny all other inbound.
>
> **Together:** VNet = network layout; NSG = traffic filtering. In our HHS project, **AKS runs in a private subnet** with NSGs controlling what traffic can reach the cluster.


---

## 12. What is the difference between Public and Private Endpoints?


---

## 13. Which monitoring tools have you used?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "We use a **three-pillar observability stack** on Azure — **metrics, logs, and traces**:
>
> **Metrics — Prometheus + Grafana:**
> - Prometheus scrapes **AKS pod/node metrics** (CPU, memory, restarts, HTTP rates)
> - **Grafana dashboards** per team/service with **alert rules** — e.g., pod restart count, latency P95, node disk pressure
> - Alerts route to email/Teams; on-call checks dashboard and logs
>
> **Logs — Elasticsearch + Loki:**
> - **Loki** for Kubernetes pod logs; **Elasticsearch** for search and log parsing
> - Track application events, errors, and audit trails for gov compliance
>
> **Traces — OpenTelemetry:**
> - **OTel SDK** in microservices exports traces end-to-end
> - Identify **latency bottlenecks** across service dependencies (API → DB → cache)
>
> **Azure-native (platform layer):**
> - **Azure Monitor** + **Log Analytics** for platform logs and KQL queries
> - **Container Insights** for AKS node/pod health
> - **Application Insights** for APM where enabled
> - **Azure Service Health** — rule out regional outages first
>
> **At HHS:** On alert fire → check Grafana → drill Loki/Elasticsearch logs → OTel trace for latency → `kubectl` if K8s issue. **MTTR** improved by correlating all three pillars.
>
> **Innovation (if asked):** We piloted a **multi-agent LLM integration** (Gemini/OpenAI API) that sends alert context + logs to the model and returns **RCA hints and remediation steps** — assists engineers but does **not** replace human approval for prod changes."

### Mathew's Answer — What You Said

| Tool | Your use |
|------|----------|
| **Prometheus** | Metrics collection |
| **Grafana** | Dashboards + alerts |
| **OpenTelemetry** | Distributed traces, latency |
| **LLM multi-agent** | RCA + remediation advice from logs |


---

## 14. How do you troubleshoot production issues?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "Production issues are **alert-driven**. Grafana/Azure Monitor alerts fire for pod problems — **CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, Evicted, Pending** — or application-down alerts.
>
> **My 6-step process:**
>
> 1. **Triage** — Check priority (P0/P1/P2), blast radius, how many users/states affected
> 2. **Correlate** — Azure Service Health, recent deployments, config/Key Vault changes
> 3. **Observe** — Grafana dashboards → Loki/Log Analytics logs → OpenTelemetry traces
> 4. **Isolate** — `kubectl describe pod`, `kubectl get events`, `kubectl logs --previous`
> 5. **Mitigate first** — rollback Helm release, fix image tag, scale nodes — restore service before root cause
> 6. **Document** — Update ticket with RCA, close after verification, post-mortem for P0/P1
>
> **Example — ImagePullBackOff on AKS:**
> - `kubectl describe pod` → check Events section
> - **Common causes:** (1) wrong image tag not in **ACR** (2) **AcrPull** role missing on Managed Identity (3) auth to private ACR failed (4) PE/DNS issue
> - Fix: verify tag in ACR, check `AcrPull` RBAC, verify Workload Identity / service account, re-deploy
>
> **Example — App-to-app connectivity failure:**
> - `kubectl exec` → ping service DNS name (not IP — IPs change)
> - If network OK → check **environment variables**, ConfigMaps, Secrets from Key Vault CSI
> - Check **namespace ResourceQuota** — pod may be Pending if quota exceeded
>
> **For gov healthcare:** Communicate status to client on P0/P1 every 15–30 min until resolved."

### 🎫 Incident Priority Guide (P0 / P1 / P2 / P3) — Learn This

Companies vary slightly — this is the **standard enterprise model** interviewers expect:

| Priority | Also called | Meaning | Response time | Who acts | Example (HHS healthcare) |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **P0** | Sev-1 / Critical | **Complete outage** — production down, no workaround | **Immediate** (< 15 min) | All hands, incident commander, war room | All state portals down, PHI system unreachable |
| **P1** | Sev-2 / High | **Major degradation** — core feature broken, large user impact | **< 30–60 min** | On-call + platform lead + dev lead | One state can't submit claims; 50% error rate |
| **P2** | Sev-3 / Medium | **Partial impact** — workaround exists, limited users | **< 4 hours** | On-call engineer | Single microservice down, other states OK |
| **P3** | Sev-4 / Low | **Minor** — cosmetic, dev/test only, no prod impact | **Next business day** | Assign to backlog | Grafana dashboard broken, non-prod pod crash |


---

## 15. Which databases have you worked with?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "I've worked with several databases across our projects:
>
> | Database | Use case | Environment pattern |
> |----------|----------|---------------------|
> | **MongoDB** | Primary app datastore (HHS) | **Self-hosted** in Dev/QA (cost savings); **MongoDB Atlas** (or managed) in **Production** |
> | **PostgreSQL** | Operational/relational data | **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** — used for prod→stage data restore pipelines |
> | **Azure SQL** | Microsoft SQL workloads | Transactional apps, HA with zone redundancy |
> | **Cosmos DB** | NoSQL / globally distributed | Low-latency, multi-region scenarios |
>
> **Environment strategy:** Lower environments use **lighter/cheaper** DB (self-hosted MongoDB on AKS/VM) — production uses **fully managed PaaS** with HA. We don't replicate prod infrastructure in Dev/QA for cost optimization.
>
> **HA & DR (platform layer — my responsibility):**
> - Enable **zone-redundant HA** on Azure PostgreSQL/SQL where required
> - **Geo-redundant backup** and **point-in-time restore (PITR)** on PaaS databases
> - Scheduled **logical backups** (pg_dump / mongodump) to **Blob Storage** for extra protection and cross-region recovery
> - **Private Endpoints** for DB connectivity from AKS — no public exposure
>
> I'm not a full-time DBA — I own **provisioning, connectivity, backup, HA config, and restore pipelines**; DBAs/dev teams own query tuning."


---

## 16. What activities do you perform in database administration?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "We had a **dedicated DBA team**, but as a **platform engineer** I owned the **infrastructure and operational side** of databases:
>
> **Provisioning & configuration:**
> - Created and configured **PostgreSQL Flexible Server**, **Cosmos DB**, and **MySQL** via Terraform
> - Sized instances based on workload — vCores, storage, HA mode (zone-redundant)
> - Enabled **Private Endpoints**, disabled public access, configured **Private DNS Zones**
>
> **Connectivity & identity:**
> - Troubleshot **connection issues** between AKS pods and databases
> - Set up **Managed Identity** and **service accounts** for apps to authenticate without passwords in code
> - Stored connection strings in **Key Vault**; apps pull via Key Vault CSI driver
>
> **Backup & environment sync:**
> - Built **Azure DevOps pipelines** to dump **non-critical prod data** and restore to **Dev/Stage** — so developers work with realistic data while masking sensitive fields
> - Enabled **native PITR** on PaaS DBs; additional **pg_dump/mongodump to Blob** for pipeline-driven restores
>
> **Performance & cost (with DBA team):**
> - Monitored **vCore/DTU utilization**, connection count, slow query logs in Azure Portal
> - **Right-sized** instances based on metrics — scale up/down for cost optimization
> - Escalated **query tuning and indexing** to DBAs — my role stops at platform layer
>
> **Boundary:** I own **infra, access, backup, connectivity, sizing** — DBAs own **schema, queries, indexes**."

## 17. Have you handled production incidents?


---

## 18. Have you coordinated with clients and cross-functional teams?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "Yes — extensively. At **HHS**, we support **US state government clients** (Florida, Iowa, South Dakota) with a **follow-the-sun model** — **onshore US team** + **offshore India team**.
>
> **Cross-functional coordination:**
> - **Onshore (US):** client-facing, business context, production access, stakeholder updates
> - **Offshore (India):** platform engineering, AKS ops, CI/CD, Terraform, incident troubleshooting
> - **Developers:** bug identification, app logs, env var / config fixes
> - **DBA team:** database performance, schema, data masking
> - **Security:** VA/PT remediation, compliance for gov healthcare
>
> **How we work:**
> - Join **Teams war rooms** for **P0/P1** — even if not our component, we contribute until resolved
> - **Status updates every 15 minutes** during critical incidents
> - I have **led incident bridge calls** — coordinate onshore + offshore + dev
> - For **new infrastructure** or **cost optimization** — we propose, onshore validates with client
> - **Release windows** coordinated across time zones — US team approves prod changes
>
> **Example:** During **ImagePullBackOff P1**, I led troubleshooting on the bridge call — offshore fixed Terraform RBAC while onshore updated the client every 15 min until resolved in 10 minutes.
>
> Strong rapport built over years — clear communication is as important as technical skills in gov healthcare."


# SECTION 2: DEEP-DIVE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

---

## 19. Explain the architecture of your current Azure environment.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **Overview:** HHS healthcare platform — **30+ microservices on private AKS**, provisioned via **Terraform**, US state government clients.
>
> **Traffic flow:**
> ```
> User (Browser → URL)
>   → Azure DNS
>   → Azure Front Door (global routing to nearest healthy region)
>   → Application Gateway (WAF + SSL)
>   → AGIC (Application Gateway Ingress Controller)
>   → Ingress → Services → Pods
>   → Databases (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
> ```
>
> **Networking:** Everything in a **private VNet** with **dedicated subnets** — AKS nodes, App Gateway, Private Endpoints in separate subnets. **No public exposure** on AKS. **Azure Bastion** for secure engineer access (no public SSH/RDP).
>
> **Integrations:** **ACR** + **Key Vault** via **Managed Identity** and **Workload Identity Federation**. **Private Endpoints** on PaaS services. **Azure DevOps** CI/CD → ACR → Helm → AKS.
>
> **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Loki/Elasticsearch.
>
> **Hub-spoke:** Our current project uses a **single VNet architecture** (not hub-spoke). I understand hub-spoke conceptually — **hub** centralizes firewall/VPN/Bastion; **spokes** connect via **VNet peering**; on-premises via **ExpressRoute/VPN** to hub. Ready to implement if required."

## 20. How do you troubleshoot a VM that is suddenly unreachable?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "I follow a **layered checklist** — platform first, then network, then OS:
>
> **1. Azure platform (Portal):**
> - VM **power state** — running or stopped?
> - **Resource Health** + **Azure Service Health** — region outage?
> - **Activity Log** — recent NSG change, patch, reboot?
>
> **2. DNS (if using hostname):**
> - `nslookup` — does FQDN resolve to correct **public IP**?
> - Verify **Azure DNS** A-record matches assigned IP
>
> **3. Networking:**
> - **NSG rules** — inbound 22/3389 or app port allowed?
> - **ASG** (Application Security Group) rules if used
> - **Azure Firewall** rules if traffic routes through firewall
> - **Effective routes** — traffic going where expected?
> - **Public IP** assigned and associated to NIC?
> - **Network Watcher** → Connection Troubleshoot / IP Flow Verify
>
> **4. Access VM (when network looks OK):**
> - **Azure Bastion** — connect without public IP
> - **Serial Console** + **Boot Diagnostics** — check boot logs if SSH/RDP fails (disk full, fstab error, kernel panic)
> - **VMAccess extension** — reset SSH key or local admin password
>
> **5. Metrics (Azure Monitor):**
> - CPU, memory, **disk space** (>90% can cause failures), network I/O
> - High CPU or full disk often explains "unreachable" symptoms
>
> **6. Recovery:**
> - Restore from **Azure Backup** snapshot
> - Attach OS disk to **rescue VM** if corrupted
> - Redeploy VM keeping data disk
>
> **Root cause examples I've seen:** NSG rule change, disk full, failed patch, wrong DNS mapping, expired SSH key."

## 21. How would you perform DR testing in Azure?


---

## 22. Explain the complete AKS architecture.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **1. Control Plane (Microsoft-managed — free in standard tier):**
> - **API Server** — all `kubectl`/Helm commands go here; stores cluster state
> - **etcd** — distributed key-value store for cluster state
> - **Scheduler** — assigns pods to nodes
> - **Controller Manager** — maintains desired state (replicas, endpoints)
> - We never manage these — Azure handles HA, patching, upgrades
>
> **2. Node Pools (we manage — VM Scale Sets):**
> - **System node pool** — runs `kube-system` pods (CoreDNS, metrics-server, monitoring agents). Keep stable; don't run app workloads here
> - **User node pools** — segregated by workload:
>   - **Normal workloads** — standard VM SKUs
>   - **Spot node pool** — cheaper, fault-tolerant batch/CI jobs
>   - **GPU node pool** — ML/GPU workloads (if needed)
> - Each node runs: **kubelet**, **kube-proxy**, **containerd** (container runtime)
>
> **3. DaemonSets on every node:**
> - **CNI plugin (Azure CNI)** — assigns pod IPs from VNet subnet; VNet integration
> - **CSI drivers** — connect pods to Azure services:
>   - Disk CSI → Azure Managed Disks (PVs)
>   - Key Vault CSI → secrets as volumes
>   - ACR pull via **Managed Identity** (not CSI but identity layer)
>
> **4. Networking & Ingress:**
> - **Private AKS** in VNet subnets — no public API or nodes
> - **AGIC** — Application Gateway Ingress Controller routes external traffic to pods
> - **Network policies** — restrict pod-to-pod traffic
>
> **5. Identity & integrations:**
> - **Managed Identity** on cluster + **Workload Identity Federation** for pods
> - **ACR** image pull, **Key Vault** secrets — no credentials in code
>
> **6. Add-ons we run:** Prometheus/Grafana, Velero, AGIC, Key Vault CSI, OpenTelemetry collector"

## 23. How do you perform AKS cluster upgrades?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **Pre-upgrade (planning):**
> 1. Review **Kubernetes release notes** — deprecated APIs, breaking changes
> 2. Check compatibility: **Helm charts**, **Argo CD**, ingress (AGIC), monitoring addons
> 3. Run **`kubectl convert`** / API deprecation checks on manifests
> 4. Confirm **application runtimes** support target K8s version — coordinate with developers
> 5. Upgrade **non-prod first**; wait 1–2 weeks before production
>
> **Backup before upgrade:**
> - **Velero** — namespace-level backup to Blob Storage
> - **Disk snapshots** — PVs / StatefulSets
> - **Terraform (IaC)** ready — can spin up new cluster in same or DR region if catastrophic failure
> - **Drift detection pipeline** — runs frequently; if infra drift detected, reconcile Terraform code before upgrade
>
> **Upgrade execution (order matters):**
> 1. **Control plane first** — `az aks upgrade --kubernetes-version x.y.z` — API server briefly unavailable
> 2. **Node pools one by one** — never all at once
>    - Check **PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB)** and replica counts before drain
>    - Use **surge settings** (`maxSurge: 33%`) — cordon → drain → new nodes → verify pods healthy
>    - Only proceed to next node pool when all pods are running
> 3. **Add-ons / plugins last** — AGIC, Key Vault CSI, Prometheus, Velero — upgrade to compatible versions
>
> **Post-upgrade validation:**
> - `kubectl get nodes` — all Ready on new version
> - Smoke tests, Grafana dashboards clean, no CrashLoopBackOff
> - Rollback plan: new node pool on old K8s version + migrate workloads if needed
>
> Azure supports **last 3 K8s versions** — upgrade within support window before version goes end-of-life."

## 24. How do you troubleshoot pods in CrashLoopBackOff state?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **Alert** fires in **Grafana** — pod restart count or CrashLoopBackOff state.
>
> **Step 1 — Describe pod (always first):**
> ```bash
> kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
> kubectl get events -n <namespace> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
> ```
> Check **Events** section — exit code, OOMKilled, probe failure, CreateContainerConfigError
>
> **Step 2 — Previous container logs (if describe unclear):**
> ```bash
> kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous
> ```
> `--previous` is critical — current container may not have logs yet; **previous** shows why last crash happened
>
> **Step 3 — Identify root cause and fix:**

| Cause | What to check | Fix |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| **App crash** | `--previous` logs, stack trace | Fix code/config, rollback Helm release |
| **Missing env vars / secrets** | describe → CreateContainerConfigError | ConfigMap, Secret, **Key Vault CSI** mount |
| **OOMKilled** | describe → `OOMKilled`, `kubectl top pod` | Increase memory limits, fix memory leak |
| **Liveness probe too aggressive** | describe → probe failures | Increase `initialDelaySeconds`, `failureThreshold` |
| **Wrong image / tag** | describe → ErrImagePull (different from CrashLoop) | Fix image tag in deployment |
| **Init container failure** | describe → init container status | `kubectl logs <pod> -c <init-container>` |
| **Permission / securityContext** | describe → permission denied | Fix `runAsUser`, `fsGroup`, volume mounts |
>
> **Step 4 — Mitigate:** `helm rollback` or fix manifest → redeploy → verify pod Running in Grafana
>
> **Real example (Q17):** ImagePullBackOff was auth issue — different state but same describe/logs workflow."

## 25. Explain HPA and Cluster Autoscaler.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler):**
> - Scales **number of pods** in a Deployment/StatefulSet **horizontally**
> - **Metrics Server** (or Prometheus adapter) collects CPU/memory metrics
> - HPA compares **average metric** vs target threshold — e.g., CPU > 70%
> - Scales **up** (add pods) or **down** (remove pods) automatically
> - Scope: **single workload** (one Deployment)
>
> **Cluster Autoscaler:**
> - Scales **number of nodes** in a **node pool**
> - Triggers when pods are **Pending** — cannot be scheduled because no node has enough CPU/memory
> - Adds nodes to node pool; removes **underutilized nodes** when pods can be rescheduled elsewhere
> - Scope: **entire node pool**
>
> **How they work together:**
> ```
> Traffic spike → HPA adds more pods
>     → Pods go Pending (no node capacity)
>     → Cluster Autoscaler adds nodes
>     → Pods scheduled → service handles load
> ```
>
> **Bonus:** **KEDA** for event-driven scaling — e.g., Azure Service Bus queue depth, HTTP rate — beyond CPU/memory."

### Important Points
- **HPA** scales **pods**; **Cluster Autoscaler** scales **nodes** — different layers
- HPA uses **Metrics Server** (CPU/memory) or **Prometheus adapter** / **KEDA** for custom metrics
- Cluster Autoscaler triggers on **Pending pods** (unschedulable), not node CPU utilization graphs
- Flow: traffic ↑ → HPA adds pods → pods Pending → CA adds nodes
- Configure `minReplicas`/`maxReplicas` (HPA) and `min-count`/`max-count` (node pool + CA)
- **KEDA** — event-driven scale (Azure Service Bus queue depth, HTTP rate)

### Likely Follow-Up Questions
| Follow-up | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| HPA not scaling? | Metrics Server missing, wrong apiVersion, requests/limits not set on pods |
| CA not adding nodes? | Pod limits, max node count reached, CA not enabled on pool |
| HPA vs VPA? | HPA = horizontal (more pods); VPA = vertical (bigger pod resources) |

## 26. A production application is running slow in AKS. How will you troubleshoot it?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **1. Triage — define scope:**
> - All users or one state? All APIs or one endpoint? When did it start? Recent deployment?
>
> **2. Observability (your approach — expand):**
> - **Grafana dashboards** — latency P95/P99, error rate, pod restart spikes
> - **`kubectl top pods`** — CPU/memory per pod; throttling?
> - **`kubectl top nodes`** — node pressure?
> - **Namespace + pod events:** `kubectl get events -n <ns> --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'`
> - **Pod logs:** `kubectl logs <pod> -f` — errors, timeouts
> - **OpenTelemetry traces** — which dependency is slow? (API → DB → cache)
>
> **3. Layer by layer:**

| Layer | Check | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| **Ingress** | App Gateway / Front Door latency, 5xx | WAF rule, backend pool health |
| **Pods** | CPU/mem high → resource issue | Scale HPA, increase limits, add nodes (Cluster Autoscaler) |
| **App** | Logs — exceptions, thread pool exhaustion | Rollback deploy, fix code |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL vCore/connections, slow queries | Scale DB, connection pool, escalate to DBA |
| **Cache** | Redis hit ratio, evictions | Increase Redis memory |
| **Network** | Private Endpoint DNS latency | Fix DNS, NSG |
| **External API** | OTel dependency span slow | Contact vendor, add timeout/circuit breaker |
>
> **4. Mitigate first:** Scale HPA, add nodes, rollback bad Helm release — restore SLA, RCA after.
>
> **5. Your quick path (valid for interview start):**
> ```
> Grafana alert → kubectl top pod → events → logs
>   → CPU/mem high? → HPA scale / increase limits
>   → DB slow in traces? → check PostgreSQL metrics
>   → Recent deploy? → helm rollback
> ```"


---

### Important Points
- Start with **scope** (who, when, which API) and **correlate with deploy**
- **Grafana** + **`kubectl top`** + **events** + **logs** + **OpenTelemetry traces**
- Slowness is often **database** or **ingress** — not always pod CPU
- Mitigate first: **HPA scale**, **helm rollback**, **DB scale** — then RCA

### Likely Follow-Up Questions
| Follow-up | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| How find slow dependency? | OpenTelemetry trace waterfall — longest span |
| CPU normal but slow? | Check DB connections, external APIs, thread pool |

## 27. Explain how VNets, Subnets, NSGs, and Route Tables work together.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> - **VNet:** Top-level network boundary (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`)
> - **Subnet:** Segments within VNet (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24` for web, `10.0.2.0/24` for data). Resources get IPs from subnet range.
> - **NSG:** Attached to subnet or NIC — **filters traffic** (allow/deny) based on 5-tuple rules. Evaluated by priority.
> - **Route Table (UDR):** Attached to subnet — controls **where traffic is routed** (default system routes vs. custom: force tunnel through Firewall, route to NVA, BGP from ExpressRoute).
>
> **Flow example:** Pod in AKS → subnet route table sends egress to Azure Firewall → NSG on subnet allows outbound 443 → Firewall applies application rules → internet.
>
> **Effective routes + effective security rules** in Portal show the actual result of all combined rules.

---

### Important Points
- **VNet** = address space; **Subnet** = segment; resources get IPs from subnet
- **NSG** = allow/deny traffic (L4); attached to subnet or NIC; rules by **priority** (5-tuple)
- **Route Table (UDR)** = where packets go; overrides system routes
- **NAT Gateway / Firewall** = outbound internet for private resources (SNAT / inspection)
- **NSG filters** — **Route Table routes** — do not confuse the two
- Evaluate **Effective routes** + **Effective security rules** in Portal

**Inbound:** `Browser → DNS → Front Door → App Gateway → AGIC → Ingress → Service → Pod`

**Outbound:** `Pod → Route Table → NSG → Firewall/NAT Gateway → Internet` (NOT through AGIC)

### Likely Follow-Up Questions
| Follow-up | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| NSG vs Firewall? | NSG = distributed L4; Firewall = centralized L3–L7 + threat intel |
| AKS pod egress? | Azure CNI assigns pod IPs — UDR on pod subnet controls egress path |

## 28. Explain ExpressRoute and VPN connectivity.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


| Aspect | Site-to-Site VPN | ExpressRoute |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Path** | Encrypted over public internet (IPsec/IKE) | Private dedicated connection via connectivity provider |
| **Bandwidth** | Up to ~1.25 Gbps (VpnGw scale) | 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps |
| **Latency** | Variable | Consistent, lower |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher (provider + port fees) |
| **Use case** | Branch offices, dev/test, backup | Enterprise production, compliance, high throughput |

> "In hybrid setups I often use **ExpressRoute as primary** and **VPN as backup** (ExpressRoute + VPN coexistence). BGP propagates on-premises routes into Azure VNet. For hub-spoke, route tables in spokes point to hub NVA/Firewall for inspection."

### Important Points
- **VPN (Site-to-Site):** Public internet + **IPsec/IKE** tunnel → **VPN Gateway** on VNet
- **ExpressRoute:** **Private** dedicated circuit via **connectivity provider** → **ExpressRoute Gateway** on VNet
- **Do not mix gateways** — VPN Gateway ≠ ExpressRoute Gateway
- **VPN:** lower cost, lower bandwidth (~1.25 Gbps max), good for branch/dev/**failover**
- **ExpressRoute:** higher cost, 50 Mbps–100 Gbps, consistent latency, compliance/production
- **Together:** ExpressRoute **primary** + VPN **backup** if ExpressRoute fails
- **BGP** exchanges routes between on-prem and Azure automatically

### Likely Follow-Up Questions
| Follow-up | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| ExpressRoute vs VPN for healthcare gov? | ExpressRoute for prod/compliance; VPN as backup |
| What is BGP? | Dynamic route exchange — on-prem networks advertised to Azure and vice versa |

---

## 29. Explain your Azure DevOps pipeline architecture.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> Our Azure DevOps architecture has **CI and CD separated**.
>
> **CI:** Trigger on merge to `develop` → checkout → **GitLeaks** → **Trivy FS** → build → unit tests → **SonarQube** quality gate → Docker build → **Trivy image scan** → push to **ACR** with tag (**buildId + git SHA**).
>
> **CD:** Promote **same image tag** through **Dev** (auto) → **QA** (tests) → **Prod** (**manual approval**). Deploy to **AKS** via **Helm**. Service connections use **Workload Identity Federation** — no secrets in YAML.
>
> **Argo CD** handles GitOps where Helm values/manifests in Git auto-sync to cluster. **Terraform** runs in a **separate pipeline** for infrastructure.

### Important Points
- **CI** = build, test, scan, publish image | **CD** = deploy per environment
- Never deploy `latest` to Prod — promote **same tested ACR tag**
- **GitLeaks** (secrets) → **Trivy** (vulns) → **SonarQube** (quality gate) = DevSecOps chain
- **Helm** = pipeline deploys | **Argo CD** = Git changes auto-sync (GitOps)
- **Terraform** = separate IaC pipeline (plan on PR, apply on merge)
- **Workload Identity Federation** for service connections — no PATs/secrets in YAML

### Likely Follow-Up Questions
| Follow-up | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| SonarQube gate fails? | Pipeline stops — fix code or get approved exception |
| Helm vs Argo CD? | Helm = pipeline pushes; Argo CD watches Git repo and reconciles cluster state |
| How secure ACR push? | Service connection + Managed Identity / Workload Identity Federation |

## 30. Explain Blue-Green and Canary deployments.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> **Blue-Green:** Two **identical environments** — **Blue** = live, **Green** = new version. On deploy, **switch all traffic instantly** from Blue to Green. If issues → **switch back to Blue** immediately. Fast rollback, but **2x cost** during deploy.
>
> **Canary:** **Same cluster**, two versions running. Route traffic **gradually by percentage** (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%) to the new version. Monitor metrics/errors. If problems → stop canary (only small % affected). On AKS: **Ingress weights**, **Flagger**, or **Argo Rollouts**.
>
> **Rolling update (AKS default):** Replace pods **incrementally**. Control with `maxSurge` / `maxUnavailable`. **PDB** ensures minimum availability. Rollback: `kubectl rollout undo` or `helm rollback`.

### Important Points
- Blue-Green = **instant switch** (not split traffic)
- Canary = **percentage gradual** (not two full environments)
- Rolling = default K8s strategy — pod-by-pod replacement
- Blue-Green rollback = switch traffic back | Rolling = `rollout undo` | Canary = set canary weight to 0%

---

## 31. How do you perform production rollbacks?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **Application rollback (AKS):**
> ```bash
> helm rollback <release> <revision> -n <namespace>
> # or
> kubectl rollout undo deployment/<name> -n <namespace>
> ```
>
> **Pipeline rollback:** Redeploy last known-good build from ACR (immutable tags by git SHA, never `latest` in prod).
>
> **Database:** Backward-compatible migrations only; use expand-contract pattern; rollback app before rolling back schema.
>
> **Infrastructure:** `terraform apply` previous state from version control; never manual portal changes.
>
> **Process:** Rollback is pre-documented in runbook; triggered when error rate > threshold for 5 min post-deploy; incident channel notified; post-mortem required."

---

## 32. Which monitoring tools have you integrated?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "We run a **three-pillar observability stack** on AKS — **metrics, logs, and traces** — integrated through **Grafana** as the single pane of glass.
>
> **Metrics — Prometheus + Grafana:**
> - Prometheus scrapes **AKS node and pod metrics** — CPU, memory, restarts, HTTP error rates
> - **Grafana dashboards** per service with **alert rules** for pod failures — CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, high restart count, node disk pressure
> - Alerts route to **Teams/email** for on-call
>
> **Logs — Loki + Promtail:**
> - **Promtail** ships pod logs from every node to **Loki**
> - Grafana queries Loki for log drill-down when an alert fires
>
> **Traces — OpenTelemetry:**
> - **OTel SDK** in microservices exports distributed traces
> - Identify latency bottlenecks across dependencies (API → DB → cache)
>
> **Azure-native (platform layer):**
> - **Azure Monitor** + **Log Analytics** for platform and audit logs
> - **Container Insights** for AKS cluster health
> - **Application Insights** for APM where enabled
> - **Azure Service Health** — rule out regional outages first
>
> **Integration workflow at HHS:** Alert fires in Grafana → check dashboard → drill Loki logs → OTel trace for latency → `kubectl` if Kubernetes issue. Correlating all three pillars reduced **MTTR**.
>
> **CI/CD:** Azure DevOps deployment markers correlated with metric spikes post-release."

### Important Points

| Pillar | Tool | Integration |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Metrics | Prometheus → Grafana | Scrape pods/nodes; alert rules → Teams |
| Logs | Promtail → Loki → Grafana | Log drill-down from alert |
| Traces | OpenTelemetry → Grafana/backend | End-to-end latency |
| Platform | Azure Monitor, Container Insights | AKS/node health, KQL queries |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- How do Prometheus and Grafana connect? (ServiceMonitor / scrape config)
- What happens when an alert fires? (dashboard → logs → traces → kubectl)
- Difference between Container Insights and Prometheus?
- How do you avoid alert fatigue?

---

## 33. What alerts do you usually configure in production environments?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "In production we configure **category-based alerts** — each with a **linked runbook**. We deliberately reduced alert count so **every alert is actionable** — no noise.
>
> | Category | Examples | Severity |
> |----------|----------|----------|
> | **Availability** | CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, ImagePullBackOff, Pending, HTTP 5xx rate | P1 / Sev 1 |
> | **Performance** | P95 latency > 2s, CPU > 85%, memory > 90% | P2 / Sev 2 |
> | **Capacity** | Disk > 80%, node pool near max, DB connection pool exhaustion | P2 |
> | **Security** | Key Vault access anomalies, failed login spikes, Defender for Cloud alerts | P1–P2 |
> | **Backup/DR** | Backup job failed, ASR replication lag | P2 |
> | **Certificate** | TLS cert expiry < 30 days | P2 |
> | **Cost** | Budget threshold 80%/100% | P3 |
>
> Alerts route to **Teams/on-call**. On fire → follow runbook → Grafana → logs → mitigate. We tune thresholds post-incident to keep false positives low."

### Important Points

- **Every alert = runbook** — no alert without an action
- **Availability = P1** — pod failures and 5xx directly impact users
- **Backup job failed** ≠ CI/CD pipeline failure (say the right one in interview)
- **Tune regularly** — alert fatigue kills on-call effectiveness

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- How do you reduce alert fatigue?
- What's P1 vs P2 in your org?
- Example runbook for CrashLoopBackOff?

---

## 34. How do you monitor MongoDB performance?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "**Production uses MongoDB Atlas.** We rely on Atlas-native monitoring — **Performance Advisor**, **slow query logs**, and **Real-Time Performance Panel** — plus alerts on connections, replication lag, and opcounters.
>
> **Key metrics we watch:**
> - CPU, memory, disk usage
> - Active connections and **connection pool exhaustion** from apps
> - **Replication lag** (replica set health)
> - Slow queries and **missing indexes** — look for **COLLSCAN** (collection scans, not table scans — MongoDB uses **collections**)
> - Query execution times and index usage
>
> **Integration:** **MongoDB exporter** → **Prometheus** → **Grafana** dashboards for unified observability alongside AKS metrics.
>
> **Lower environments:** Same exporter pipeline; we also use `mongostat` / `explain()` on slow queries for troubleshooting.
>
> **Red flags:** COLLSCAN on large collections, rising connection count, replication lag > threshold, working set exceeding RAM."

### Important Points

| Term | Correct |
|------|---------|
| MongoDB data unit | **Collections** (not tables) |
| Missing index symptom | **COLLSCAN** in query plan |
| Your stack | Atlas + MongoDB exporter → Prometheus → Grafana |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- What is COLLSCAN and how do you fix it?
- How do you find slow queries in Atlas?
- Connection pool exhaustion — what causes it?

---

## 35. Explain Redis replication and failover.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "**Redis replication** creates an **asynchronous copy** of the primary for **high availability** and **read scaling**. The primary handles writes; replicas sync via `PSYNC`.
>
> **Lower environments — self-managed Redis:**
> - **Master + replica** topology with **Redis Sentinel**
> - Sentinel monitors the primary; on failure it **elects and promotes** a replica, then apps reconnect to the new primary
>
> **Production — Azure Cache for Redis Premium:**
> - **Primary-replica replication** with **automatic failover** (Azure-managed on Premium)
> - **Zone redundancy** for HA across availability zones
> - **Private Endpoint** — AKS pods connect over the VNet; **Private DNS zone** resolves the Redis hostname inside the cluster network
>
> **Monitoring:** `used_memory`, `evicted_keys`, `connected_clients`, replication lag
>
> **App side:** Connection multiplexer with retry/reconnect logic so failover is transparent to the application."

### Important Points

| Environment | Setup | Failover |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Lower env | Self-hosted + **Sentinel** | Sentinel promotes replica |
| Production | **Azure Redis Premium** + zone redundancy | Azure automatic failover |
| Network | **Private Endpoint** + Private DNS zone | Pods in AKS VNet only |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- Sync vs async replication — what can you lose on failover?
- Difference between Sentinel and Redis Cluster?
- How does Private Endpoint DNS work for Redis from AKS?

---

## 36. Explain your experience with Cloud Run, BigQuery, or Airflow.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "My **primary cloud is Azure**, so most of my production work is AKS, Azure DevOps, and Azure data services.
>
> **Cloud Run and BigQuery:** I don't have deep hands-on production experience with these. I understand the concepts — **Cloud Run** is serverless containers (similar to **Azure Container Apps**), and **BigQuery** is a serverless analytics warehouse (similar to **Azure Synapse** / serverless SQL patterns).
>
> **Airflow — I have practical experience:**
> - Used to **author, schedule, and monitor workflows**
> - Workflows are defined as **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)** in **Python code**
> - Each DAG has **tasks with dependencies** — upstream must succeed before downstream runs
> - Supports **retries**, scheduling (cron), and a UI to track run status
> - Pipelines are **version-controlled in Git** — scalable and repeatable for ETL/batch jobs
>
> The orchestration concepts transfer: Airflow DAG patterns map closely to **Azure Data Factory** pipelines and activity dependencies."

### Important Points

| GCP service | If no hands-on | Azure equivalent |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Cloud Run | Serverless containers | **Container Apps** |
| BigQuery | Analytics warehouse | **Synapse** / analytics SQL |
| Airflow | DAG-based orchestration | **Data Factory** pipeline patterns |

**Interview rule:** Be honest on gaps; show you know equivalents and own **Airflow** clearly.

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- What is a DAG in Airflow?
- How do task dependencies work?
- Airflow vs Azure Data Factory?

---

## 37. How do you manage monitoring across Azure and GCP?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "My production depth is **Azure**, but the multi-cloud pattern we follow — or would follow — is **one observability stack, not two**.
>
> **Unified OSS stack on both clouds:**
> - Deploy the same **Prometheus + Grafana + Loki** (and ELK where needed) on **AKS** and **GKE**
> - **Single pane of glass** — Grafana dashboards with mixed data sources from both clouds
>
> **Standardized instrumentation:**
> - **OpenTelemetry** in all microservices — self-hosted collector or export to **Application Insights** on Azure; same OTel pattern on GCP for trace correlation across services
>
> **Platform layer per cloud:**
> - **Azure:** Azure Monitor, Container Insights, Cost Management — resources tagged (`environment`, `team`, `cost-center`) for segregation
> - **GCP:** Cloud Monitoring + Logging forwarded to the same central sink (or scraped into Prometheus)
>
> **Operations:** **One on-call rotation**, **one runbook**, **one escalation policy** (Teams/PagerDuty) — avoid duplicating alert logic per cloud. Cloud-specific dashboards only where the platform differs.
>
> **Cost:** Azure Cost Management + GCP Billing export — unified FinOps view via tags."

### Important Points

| Principle | How |
|-----------|-----|
| Same stack both clouds | Prometheus/Grafana/Loki on AKS + GKE |
| Trace correlation | **OpenTelemetry** everywhere |
| No duplicate alerts | One runbook, one on-call |
| Segregation | **Consistent tags** on Azure AND GCP |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- How do you correlate traces across Azure and GCP services?
- Grafana mixed data sources — how configured?
- How avoid alert fatigue across two clouds?

---

## 38. How do you perform security hardening in Azure?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "We apply **layered security** across Azure — identity, network, compute, data, governance, secrets, and CI/CD.
>
> **Identity:** Enforce **MFA**, **Conditional Access**, **PIM** for admin roles — no standing privileged access, no shared accounts.
>
> **Network:** **WAF** on App Gateway/Front Door, **Azure Firewall** for outbound control, **NSGs** on subnets, **Private Endpoints** for PaaS services, **DDoS Protection** on public-facing resources. No public IPs on production workloads where possible.
>
> **Compute / AKS:** **Private AKS cluster**, **ACR** with trusted images only, **Defender for Cloud** image scanning, Pod Security Standards, **Workload Identity / Managed Identity** — no static credentials in pods.
>
> **Secrets:** **Key Vault** for secrets, certs, and keys — accessed via Managed Identity, never in code or repos.
>
> **Data:** Encryption at rest (**CMK** via Key Vault), **TLS 1.2+** enforced, soft delete on storage and Key Vault.
>
> **Governance:** **Azure Policy** — deny public storage, require tags, enforce HTTPS, block non-compliant resources at deploy time.
>
> **CI/CD (shift-left):** **GitLeaks**, **Trivy** image scanning, **SonarQube** in Azure DevOps pipeline before anything reaches prod.
>
> **Monitoring:** **Defender for Cloud** secure score, alerts on misconfigurations and anomalies.
>
> Everything is codified in **Terraform** so security baseline is repeatable and drift is caught early."

### Important Points

| Layer | Your HHS examples |
|-------|-------------------|
| Identity | MFA, Conditional Access, PIM |
| Network | WAF, Firewall, NSG, Private Endpoints |
| Compute | Private AKS, ACR, Defender scanning |
| Secrets | Key Vault + Managed Identity |
| Governance | Azure Policy |
| CI/CD | GitLeaks, Trivy, SonarQube |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- What is PIM and why use it?
- Private Endpoint vs Service Endpoint?
- How does Workload Identity work with Key Vault?

---

## 39. Have you handled VA/PT findings? Give examples.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "Yes. I participated in **vulnerability scanning** and **penetration testing** activities and owned **infra-side remediation** from scan reports.
>
> **Application / image scanning:**
> - **Trivy** in CI pipeline flagged CVEs in container images → we **updated base images** and rebuilt pipelines
> - **OWASP ZAP** integrated in **Jenkins** pipeline for DAST on applications → shared findings with dev team for code fixes
>
> **Azure infrastructure findings and remediation:**
> 1. **Soft delete not enabled** on critical storage/Key Vault → enabled soft delete + purge protection
> 2. **NSG ports open to 0.0.0.0/0** → restricted to known IP ranges / Bastion, **Azure Policy** to deny wide-open rules
> 3. **Public endpoints** where **Private Endpoints** were required → migrated PaaS to Private Endpoint + Private DNS
> 4. **TLS 1.0/1.1** on App Gateway → enforced **TLS 1.2 minimum** SSL policy, rescanned clean
> 5. **AKS secrets in plain Kubernetes Secrets** (base64, not encrypted) → migrated to **Key Vault CSI driver** + Workload Identity
> 6. **Overprivileged users / service principals** → scoped **Azure RBAC** to least privilege, custom roles instead of Contributor
>
> **Process:** Triage by severity/CVSS → assign owner → remediate → **rescan/retest** → close ticket. Critical findings within agreed SLA."

### Important Points

| Term | Azure interview |
|------|-----------------|
| IAM | Say **Azure RBAC** (not IAM — that's AWS) |
| K8s Secrets | Base64 ≠ encryption — use **Key Vault CSI** |
| ZAP | **OWASP ZAP** — DAST tool |
| Your tools | Trivy (images), ZAP (apps), config review (infra) |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- Difference between VA scan and PT?
- How do you prioritize findings?
- What is Key Vault CSI vs Kubernetes Secrets?

---

## 40. How do you secure AKS clusters?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "**Cluster access:**
> - **Private AKS cluster** — API server inside the VNet, not publicly accessible
> - **Microsoft Entra ID** integration with **Azure RBAC for Kubernetes** — authorized access only, no shared kubeconfig
>
> **Network:**
> - **Network Policies** — deny all by default, allow only required pod-to-pod traffic
> - **WAF on Azure Front Door** for ingress traffic to workloads behind the cluster
>
> **Identity & secrets:**
> - **Workload Identity Federation** + **Managed Identity** — pods access **Key Vault** via CSI driver, no static credentials or plain Kubernetes Secrets
>
> **Images & supply chain:**
> - **ACR** as trusted registry only; **Defender for Cloud** image scanning + **Trivy** in CI pipeline
>
> **Governance:**
> - **Azure Policy add-on** for AKS — enforce no privileged containers, required labels, approved SKUs
> - **Pod Security Admission** (restricted/baseline)
>
> **Operations:**
> - Regular **Kubernetes version upgrades** and CVE patching
> - Audit logs to **Log Analytics**"

### Important Points

| Your term | Interview polish |
|-----------|------------------|
| Entra ID | Correct — say **Microsoft Entra ID** + Azure RBAC for K8s |
| Federated identity | **Workload Identity Federation** |
| Policy engine | **Azure Policy add-on for AKS** |

## 41. How do you identify cloud cost leakages?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "I use **Azure Cost Management**, **Azure Monitor**, and **Azure Advisor** to identify where money is being wasted.
>
> **How I find leakages:**
> - **Cost Analysis** by resource and tag — spot spikes and unattached resources
> - **Advisor recommendations** — right-sizing VMs and databases, idle resources
> - Hunt for **orphaned disks, snapshots, NICs, and public IPs** still billing
> - Review **non-prod running 24/7** — VMs and AKS node pools with no auto-scale-down
> - Check **storage tiers** — Premium disks or Hot blob where Cool/Archive fits
>
> **Remediation / prevention:**
> - **Right-size** VMs and DB SKUs per Advisor
> - **Remove** orphan resources and extra snapshots
> - **Cluster Autoscaler** on AKS — scale nodes to demand, avoid idle capacity
> - **VM auto start/stop** schedules for off-hours (dev/test)
> - **Blob lifecycle policies** — move logs/backups to Cool/Archive
> - **Reserved Instances / Savings Plans** for predictable steady workloads
> - **Tags** via Azure Policy for cost allocation and showback
>
> Cost leakage is usually **orphaned resources** and **wrong SKU/tier** — monthly FinOps review with Advisor + Cost Management."

### Important Points

| Identify (find waste) | Prevent (fix waste) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Cost Analysis, Advisor | Right-sizing, cleanup |
| Orphan disks/snapshots/IPs | Delete + Policy guardrails |
| Idle non-prod 24/7 | Auto-shutdown, Cluster Autoscaler |
| Wrong storage tier | Lifecycle policies |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- Difference between RI and Savings Plans? (Q43)
- How does Cluster Autoscaler save money?
- What tags do you enforce for FinOps?

## 42. What cost optimization initiatives have you implemented?

### Sample Answer (with Metrics)

> 1. **Reserved Instances / Savings Plans** for stable AKS node pools and SQL — **~35% savings**
> 2. **Spot node pools** for CI/CD and batch workloads — **~70% compute savings** on those pools
> 3. **Auto-shutdown** schedules for dev/test VMs and scaled-down non-prod AKS at night
> 4. **Storage lifecycle policies** — moved logs/backups to Cool/Archive tier — **~40% storage reduction**
> 5. **Rightsizing** via Azure Advisor recommendations — downsized 15 VMs
> 6. **Tagging enforcement** via Policy — enabled showback/chargeback per team
> 7. **Consolidated Log Analytics** workspaces to reduce ingestion duplication

## 43. Explain Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

| Option | Commitment | Flexibility | Discount | Best For |
|--------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Reserved Instances (RI)** | 1 or 3 year, **specific VM family + region** | Low — **exchange** possible for different SKU/region | Up to **~72%** | Stable, predictable workloads (fixed SQL tier) |
| **Savings Plans** | 1 or 3 year, **$/hour spend** commitment | High — change **VM type, region**, applies across compute | Up to **~65%** | Mixed/evolving workloads (**AKS node pools**) |

> "Both are Azure **cost-saving commitment** options for 1–3 years.
>
> **Reserved Instances** lock to a VM family and region — up to **72% discount**. You can **exchange** RIs if needs change, but flexibility is limited.
>
> **Savings Plans** commit to an hourly **dollar spend** — up to **65% discount** — and flex across VM types and regions. Better when SKUs change, like **AKS node pool upgrades**.
>
> I analyze **30–90 day utilization** in Cost Management before purchasing. Savings Plans are my default for AKS; RIs for steady SQL/Cosmos tiers. Combined with **Spot** pools for CI/batch, we reduce overall compute cost significantly."

### Important Points

- **Savings Plan** = $/hour commit, flexible VM family
- **RI** = specific SKU, higher discount, less flexible
- **AKS** → prefer Savings Plans (node SKUs evolve)
- Always check **30–90 day** usage before committing

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- Can you use RI and Savings Plan together?
- What happens if you under-utilize the commitment?
- Spot vs Savings Plan for AKS?

## 44. How do you optimize storage and idle resources?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "**Storage optimization:**
> - **Blob lifecycle policies** — move logs/backups Hot → Cool → Archive automatically
> - Delete **orphaned disks, snapshots**, and old unwanted archives
> - Right **redundancy tier** — LRS for non-critical, ZRS for HA
>
> **Idle resource optimization:**
> - Use **Azure Monitor** and **Advisor** to find unused VMs, disks, public IPs, NICs
> - **Deallocate/remove** idle VMs and associated disks
> - **Auto-shutdown** schedules for dev/test VMs off-hours
> - Scale down **non-prod AKS** node pools when not in use
> - Monthly runbook to clean orphaned storage and unattached resources"

### Important Points

- **Monitor + Advisor** = find waste
- **Lifecycle policies** = prevent storage creep
- **Orphan cleanup** = disks, snapshots, NICs, IPs

## 45. Database response time has increased significantly. What will be your approach?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)

> "I follow a **structured top-down approach** — confirm scope, check infra, then drill into the database.
>
> **1. Confirm & correlate:**
> - When did it start? **Recent deploy**, config change, or Key Vault rotation?
> - Check **Grafana/App Insights** — latency spike on DB dependency span in **OpenTelemetry traces**
> - Rule out **AKS/network** — pod CPU, connection errors, Private Endpoint issues
>
> **2. Database metrics (platform layer):**
> - **Azure SQL / Cosmos:** DTU/vCore utilization, connection count, deadlocks, wait stats
> - **MongoDB Atlas:** Performance Advisor, slow query logs, opcounters, replication lag, connections
> - **Postgres:** active connections, lock waits, `pg_stat_statements`
>
> **3. Query analysis:**
> - Identify **slow queries** — missing indexes, **COLLSCAN**, full table scans
> - Run **`explain()`** / Query Performance Insight
> - Check if app released a **bad query** or N+1 pattern after deploy
>
> **4. Resource & capacity:**
> - CPU/memory/IO saturation on DB tier — need **scale-up**?
> - **Connection pool exhaustion** from AKS pods — too many replicas or leak?
> - **Redis** cache miss rate — is load hitting DB directly?
>
> **5. Mitigate & escalate:**
> - Short-term: scale DB tier, kill long-running queries, enable read replica
> - Engage **DBA team** for schema/index fixes
> - Document RCA — index added, query optimized, pool size tuned
>
> **At HHS:** Platform owns infra metrics and connectivity; DBA owns schema/query tuning — I bridge both with traces and connection troubleshooting."

### Important Points

| Layer | Check |
|-------|-------|
| App/trace | OTel — is DB span the bottleneck? |
| Connectivity | Private Endpoint, NSG, connection string |
| DB metrics | DTU/vCore, connections, replication lag |
| Queries | Slow query log, missing indexes, COLLSCAN |
| Cache | Redis hit rate — bypass cache? |

### Likely Follow-Up Questions

- How find slow query in MongoDB Atlas?
- Connection pool exhaustion — symptoms?
- Scale-up vs scale-out for Azure SQL?

## 46. How do you prioritize multiple production issues?

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> "I use **impact × urgency** matrix:
>
> | Priority | Criteria | Example |
> |----------|----------|---------|
> | **P1** | Full outage, revenue/security impact | Payment down, data breach |
> | **P2** | Major degradation, workaround exists | Slow checkout, single region |
> | **P3** | Minor impact, few users | Non-critical report failing |
> | **P4** | Cosmetic / planned | UI alignment issue |
>
> **Rules:**
> - P1 always wins — all hands, incident commander assigned
> - If two P1s: business impact (revenue > internal tools)
> - Communicate reprioritization to stakeholders
> - Don't context-switch — assign owners per incident
> - Post-incident: review if alerts should have fired earlier"

## 47. Describe a critical production issue that you resolved.

### Senior Answer (8–9 Years)


> **Situation:** At [Company], our customer-facing API experienced complete outage at 2 AM — 100% error rate, ~50,000 users affected. PagerDuty alerted within 2 minutes.
>
> **Task:** As on-call platform engineer, I was incident commander responsible for restoration and communication.
>
> **Action:**
> - Joined war room, confirmed Azure region was healthy (ruled out platform outage)
> - Checked recent deployment — new config map missing database connection string after Key Vault rotation
> - Pods were CrashLoopBackOff; rollback via `helm rollback` failed due to chart version mismatch
> - Manually applied last-known-good manifest from Git tag; scaled deployment
> - Coordinated with DBA to verify DB accepting connections; notified client every 20 min
>
> **Result:**
> - Service restored in **23 minutes**
> - Implemented pre-deploy validation step for secret references
> - Added alert for CrashLoopBackOff > 3 restarts in 5 min
> - Presented post-mortem to leadership; no SLA breach due to 99.9% monthly buffer
>
> **Lesson:** Infrastructure changes (Key Vault rotation) must trigger application pipeline validation."

# SECTION 6: FOLLOW-UP QUESTION BANK (Senior Cross-Questions)

Questions interviewers ask **after** your main answer. Prepare 2–3 sentences each.

### Q1–3: Intro / Architecture
| Follow-up | Senior answer hint |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Why Azure over AWS for this project? | Gov compliance, client requirement, AKS + Azure DevOps integration, existing Entra ID |
| What was your biggest architecture challenge? | Private AKS + PE for all PaaS + multi-state latency via Front Door |
| How many environments? | Dev, QA, Prod — separate namespaces/subscriptions, promotion via pipeline |

### Q4–7: Azure Services / AKS
| Follow-up | Senior answer hint |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Private vs public AKS cluster? | Private API server, private nodes, Bastion for admin, no public kube API |
| How do pods pull from ACR privately? | PE on ACR + Managed Identity AcrPull + Private DNS |
| Node pool failed to provision? | Quota, subnet full, NSG blocking, SKU unavailable — check `az aks nodepool list` events |
| AKS upgrade failed mid-way? | Surge nodes, cordon/drain, rollback node pool to previous K8s version |

### Q8–10: Kubernetes / CI/CD
| Follow-up | Senior answer hint |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Deployment vs StatefulSet? | Deployment = stateless; StatefulSet = stable identity + PV for DB |
| How do you rollback a bad deploy? | `helm rollback`, same ACR tag, never deploy `latest` in prod |
| SonarQube quality gate failed — what now? | Fix code or get exception approval; never bypass gate in gov prod |
| GitLeaks found a secret? | Revoke key in Azure, rotate in Key Vault, rewrite git history or invalidate commit |

### Q11–12: Networking
| Follow-up | Senior answer hint |
|-----------|-------------------|
| NSG vs Azure Firewall? | NSG = L3/L4 subnet/NIC rules; Firewall = centralized L3–L7 app rules, IDPS |
| PE vs Service Endpoint? | PE = private IP in VNet; Service Endpoint = VNet routing, service still has public IP |
| DNS not resolving for PE? | Private DNS Zone not linked to VNet, or AKS using public DNS forwarder |

### Q5–6: Backup / DR
| Follow-up | Senior answer hint |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Where are VM backups stored? | **Recovery Services Vault** — not Blob (Velero uses Blob) |
| RTO vs RPO? | RPO = max data loss window; RTO = max downtime; define per tier |
| Tested restore ever? | Yes — GitLab VM restore drill, Velero namespace restore to QA |

### Extra Senior Questions (Added — May Be Asked)
