### Kubernetes

#### Types of Services in Kubernetes
- **ClusterIP:** The default service type, which exposes the service internally within the cluster.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
- **LoadBalancer:** Provides an external IP address that forwards to the service.
- **ExternalName:** Maps the service to a pre-defined external DNS name.

#### Difference between Kubeproxy and Ingress
- **Kube Proxy:** A Kubernetes daemon that runs on each node and manages network rules for services.
- **Ingress:** A Kubernetes resource that allows you to expose HTTP and HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.

#### Kubelet
- Agent that runs on each node in the cluster, ensuring that containers are running in a Pod.

#### Control Plane
- Manages the Kubernetes cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and deploying containers. The control plane includes the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd.

#### API Server
- The Kubernetes API server is the front-end interface to the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes a REST API that clients can use to manage the cluster and its resources.

#### Advantages of Kubernetes
- Scalability, automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing, easy management, and efficient resource utilization.

### Ansible

#### Inventory File in Ansible
- Contains a list of hosts and groups, allowing Ansible to target systems.

#### Hosts File
- Specifies the details of hosts within an Ansible inventory.

#### Print Total Number of Hosts
- Use `ansible-inventory --list` or refer to the inventory file directly.

#### Handler in Ansible
- Represents a named list of tasks in Ansible, triggered by another task.

### AWS Cloud

#### Security Group in AWS Cloud
- Acts as a virtual firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances.

#### S3 Bucket
- Simple Storage Service in AWS, used to store and retrieve data.

#### Types of S3 Bucket
- Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-Infrequent Access, One Zone-Infrequent Access, and Glacier.

#### Storage Class in S3 Bucket
- Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-Infrequent Access, One Zone-Infrequent Access, Glacier, and Deep Archive.

#### Types of EC2 Instances
- General purpose, Compute optimized, Memory optimized, Storage optimized, and Accelerated computing.

#### Internet Gateway
- Connects a VPC to the internet, allowing resources within the VPC to access the internet and be accessed by the internet.

#### Cloud vs. On-Premises DevOps
- Cloud DevOps offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, while On-Premises DevOps provides more control and security.

### Prometheus & Grafana

#### Types of Metrics in Prometheus
- Counters, Gauges, Histograms, and Summaries.

#### Prometheus and Grafana
- Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting toolkit, while Grafana is a multi-platform open-source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

# Terraform

#### Use of Terraform Plan and Apply Command
- `terraform plan` is used to create an execution plan, while `terraform apply` is used to apply the changes.

#### Terraform
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to build, change, and version infrastructure efficiently and safely.

**Terraform state file**

A Terraform state file is a file that stores information about the resources that Terraform manages. It is used by Terraform to track which resources exist, their attributes, and their relationships to other resources.

Here is a short summary of the key points:
- Terraform needs to store state to track which resources exist and their attributes, to track the relationships between resources, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.
- Best practices for managing Terraform state include storing it in a remote location, backing it up regularly, using version control, and being careful when sharing it with others.

## Terraform advantages

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code. It has a number of advantages over traditional methods of managing infrastructure, including:

- **Consistency:** Terraform uses a high-level configuration language to define your infrastructure, which means that you can specify the desired state of your infrastructure in a consistent and predictable way. This helps to reduce errors and ensure that your infrastructure is always configured correctly.

- **Reusability:** You can define reusable modules in Terraform, which can be used to create and manage complex infrastructure components. This can save you time and effort, and help you to ensure that your infrastructure is consistent and well-organized.

- **Portability:** Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure on a variety of cloud providers, as well as on-premises. This gives you the flexibility to choose the right platform for your needs, without having to lock yourself into a particular vendor.

- **Collaboration:** Terraform stores its configuration in human-readable files, which makes it easy to collaborate with other engineers on your infrastructure projects. You can also use version control to track changes to your configuration and to roll back to previous versions if necessary.

- **Automation:** Terraform can be used to automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure. This can help you to save time and effort, and to reduce the risk of human error.

In addition to these advantages, Terraform is also a very active and well-supported project. There is a large community of Terraform users and contributors, and there are many resources available to help you get started with Terraform and to learn how to use it effectively.

## Benefits of using Terraform

- **Improved consistency:** Terraform helps to ensure that your infrastructure is always configured correctly by defining its desired state in a consistent and predictable way.

- **Reduced errors:** Terraform can help to reduce errors by automating the deployment and management of your infrastructure.

- **Increased efficiency:** Terraform can help you to save time and effort by automating repetitive tasks, such as creating and destroying resources.

- **Enhanced collaboration:** Terraform makes it easy to collaborate with other engineers on your infrastructure projects by storing its configuration in human-readable files.

- **Improved compliance:** Terraform can help you to improve compliance by ensuring that your infrastructure is always configured in accordance with your organization's policies.
