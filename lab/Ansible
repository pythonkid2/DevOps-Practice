Create 2 ubuntu machines 20.04 
---> SSH

while having same user in both machine we can connect using ssh 
    ssh <ip> 

1, Create a user 
    with same name and password
    enable password based authentication
    establish ssh connectivity 


Do the following on all nodes.
	sudo su
	#create user called "vilas"
	useradd -m -s /bin/bash vilas
	#setup password
	passwd vilas

	#add to sudo groups

+++

centos (on worker/slave nodes)

	Without this user would be prompted for sudo user's access issue.
	Making yourself a super user. Open /etc/sudoers. Make sure following two lines are uncommented:
	## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
	%wheel ALL=(ALL)       ALL

	## Same thing without a password
	%wheel ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
	vilas ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

	Add yourself to wheel group.

	usermod -aG wheel <yourname> 
	usermod -aG wheel vilas


+++

ubuntu (on worker/slave nodes)

	usermod -aG sudo <yourname> 
	usermod -aG sudo vilas
