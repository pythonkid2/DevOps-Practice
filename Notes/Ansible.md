**Infrastructure as Code**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts. It treats infrastructure as software, enabling automation and ensuring consistency. IaC facilitates scalability, faster deployment, and reduced errors. Popular tools include Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, and Chef.

**Configuration management**

Configuration management is a crucial aspect of IT operations that involves systematically managing changes to a system's configuration. It ensures that the performance, functionality, and other attributes of the system remain consistent over time.

Types of configuration management:

- Software Configuration Management (SCM)
- Infrastructure Configuration Management
- Change Management
- Database Configuration Management
- Component Configuration Management
 
Different approaches for applying configuration changes to target systems:

- **Push Configuration Management:** The central server pushes changes to target systems simultaneously. Ansible and SaltStack utilize this approach for orchestrated configuration management across multiple nodes without requiring dedicated agents.

- **Pull Configuration Management:** Target systems actively retrieve configurations from a central server. Tools like Puppet and Chef commonly use this method, with target nodes periodically checking for and applying available updates.

- **Agentless Approach:** Ansible adopts an agentless methodology, allowing management and execution of tasks on remote systems without the need for dedicated agent installations. This approach simplifies deployment and reduces overhead.

# Ansible

Ansible is agentless, utilizing **SSH** for Linux and **PowerShell remoting** for Windows, enabling seamless management without the need for additional software on the target machines.
- If the **inventory file** is not specified, Ansible looks for the default file located at **/etc/ansible/hosts**. This file contains data about the target machines, allowing Ansible to manage them seamlessly.

**Playbook**: A YAML file that defines tasks to be executed on managed nodes, forming the core of system configuration and orchestration.

**Play**: An ordered set of tasks within a playbook, mapping hosts to specific tasks. Plays allow for task organization based on criteria like target hosts or roles.

- Hosts: Specifies the hosts or group of hosts on which the playbook should be run.
- Tasks: Defines a list of actions to be performed on the hosts. These can include module executions, file operations, or other operations.
- Variables: Declares variables that can be used within the playbook to parameterize tasks or templates.
- Handlers: Defines tasks that can be triggered by other tasks and are used to manage services.
- Roles: Organizes related tasks and files into a reusable and distributable component.

```
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

To operate the Ansible playbooks and ensure smooth execution, consider the following commands:

- To run a playbook named 'your_playbook.yml', use the command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml`

- To run the 'your_playbook.yml' playbook in check mode, utilize the command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --check`

- To check the 'your_playbook.yml' playbook for syntax errors, execute: `ansible-playbook --syntax-check your_playbook.yml`

- To perform an Ansible-lint check on the 'your_playbook.yml' playbook, run the command: `ansible-lint your_playbook.yml`


## Check Mode vs Diff Mode

### Check Mode:
- Command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --check`
- Performs a dry run of the playbook, reporting the changes it would make without applying them.
- Useful for understanding the impact of the playbook before execution.

### Diff Mode:
- Command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --diff`
- Displays the differences between the current configuration and the proposed changes from the playbook.
- Helps in reviewing and verifying changes before applying them.
