### **DevOps Project Workflow**  

#### **1. Development Workflow**  
- **Main Branch**: Contains production-ready code that is thoroughly tested and reviewed.  
- **Pre-Main/PPOD Branch**:  
  - Developers write and test code on their local machines.  
  - Once local testing is complete, code is pushed to the pre-main branch.  
  - Developers raise **pull/merge requests** for their changes.  
  - The architecture team reviews and verifies the code before merging it into the main branch.  
- **Webhooks**: DevOps team configures webhooks to trigger the CI/CD pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

#### **2. CI/CD Pipeline**  
**Stages in the Pipeline**:  

1. **Checkout**:  
   - Creates a local copy of the application's source code inside Jenkins or any other CI/CD tool.  

2. **Compile**:  
   - Identifies syntax errors during the compilation of the source code.  

3. **Unit Testing**:  
   - Validates the applicationâ€™s source code to ensure it functions as expected.  
   - Reports any failing test cases to developers.  

4. **SonarQube**:  
   - **Code Quality Check**: Detects bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.  
   - **Code Coverage**: Analyzes how much of the code is tested by the unit tests to ensure comprehensive test coverage.  

5. **Trivy (Security Scanning)**:  
   - Scans the file system, including configuration files, for vulnerabilities.  
   - Detects exposed passwords, tokens, or any sensitive information.  

6. **Build the Application**:  
   - Generates the build artifact (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, or binary).  

7. **Trivy Artifact Scan**:  
   - Scans the generated artifact and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.  

8. **Publish Artifact**:  
   - Publishes the artifact to a repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory).  

9. **Build Docker Image**:  
   - Creates a Docker image containing the application artifact.  

10. **Docker Image Security Scan**:  
    - Scans the Docker image (including the base image, application artifact, and dependencies) using **Trivy** to detect vulnerabilities.  

11. **Push Docker Image**:  
    - Pushes the scanned Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR).  

12. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:  
    - Deploys the application to a Kubernetes cluster using pre-scanned manifest files.  

13. **Penetration Testing**:  
    - After deployment, manually test the application using penetration testing tools to identify vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite).

#### **3. Monitoring**  
- **Prometheus**: Collects application and infrastructure metrics.  
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and sets up alerts for real-time monitoring.

### **Security Best Practices**  
- **Credentials Management**:  
  - Use a separate service account with **minimum privileges**.  
  - Create and securely store credentials (e.g., in Jenkins, AWS Secrets Manager, or HashiCorp Vault).  
- **Vulnerability Scanning**:  
  - Use tools like **Trivy** to scan artifacts, Docker images, and configuration files.  
- **Secure Secrets**: Ensure no passwords, API keys, or sensitive information are exposed in the codebase.  
- **Code Reviews**: Enforce thorough peer reviews before merging code into the main branch.  
- **Static Analysis**: Implement automated tools like SonarQube for static code analysis to detect issues early.
