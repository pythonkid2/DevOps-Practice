**Infrastructure as Code**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable scripts. It treats infrastructure as software, enabling automation and ensuring consistency. IaC facilitates scalability, faster deployment, and reduced errors. Popular tools include Ansible, Terraform, Puppet, and Chef.

**Configuration management**

Configuration management is a crucial aspect of IT operations that involves systematically managing changes to a system's configuration. It ensures that the performance, functionality, and other attributes of the system remain consistent over time.

Types of configuration management:

- Software Configuration Management (SCM)
- Infrastructure Configuration Management
- Change Management
- Database Configuration Management
- Component Configuration Management
 
Different approaches for applying configuration changes to target systems:

- **Push Configuration Management:** The central server pushes changes to target systems simultaneously. Ansible and SaltStack utilize this approach for orchestrated configuration management across multiple nodes without requiring dedicated agents.

- **Pull Configuration Management:** Target systems actively retrieve configurations from a central server. Tools like Puppet and Chef commonly use this method, with target nodes periodically checking for and applying available updates.

- **Agentless Approach:** Ansible adopts an agentless methodology, allowing management and execution of tasks on remote systems without the need for dedicated agent installations. This approach simplifies deployment and reduces overhead.

# Ansible

Ansible is agentless, utilizing **SSH** for Linux and **PowerShell remoting** for Windows, enabling seamless management without the need for additional software on the target machines.
- If the **inventory file** is not specified, Ansible looks for the default file located at **/etc/ansible/hosts**. This file contains data about the target machines, allowing Ansible to manage them seamlessly.

**Playbook**: A YAML file that defines tasks to be executed on managed nodes, forming the core of system configuration and orchestration.

**Play**: An ordered set of tasks within a playbook, mapping hosts to specific tasks. Plays allow for task organization based on criteria like target hosts or roles.

- Hosts: Specifies the hosts or group of hosts on which the playbook should be run.
- Tasks: Defines a list of actions to be performed on the hosts. These can include module executions, file operations, or other operations.
- Variables: Declares variables that can be used within the playbook to parameterize tasks or templates.
- Handlers: Defines tasks that can be triggered by other tasks and are used to manage services.
- Roles: Organizes related tasks and files into a reusable and distributable component.

```
- hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure Apache is installed
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Ensure Apache is running
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

To operate the Ansible playbooks and ensure smooth execution, consider the following commands:

- To run a playbook named 'your_playbook.yml', use the command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml`

- To run the 'your_playbook.yml' playbook in check mode, utilize the command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --check`

- To check the 'your_playbook.yml' playbook for syntax errors, execute: `ansible-playbook --syntax-check your_playbook.yml`

- To perform an Ansible-lint check on the 'your_playbook.yml' playbook, run the command: `ansible-lint your_playbook.yml`


## Check Mode vs Diff Mode

### Check Mode:
- Command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --check`
- Performs a dry run of the playbook, reporting the changes it would make without applying them.
- Useful for understanding the impact of the playbook before execution.

### Diff Mode:
- Command: `ansible-playbook your_playbook.yml --diff`
- Displays the differences between the current configuration and the proposed changes from the playbook.
- Helps in reviewing and verifying changes before applying them.

# Variables and Defining Tasks in Ansible

## Variables in Ansible

In Ansible, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during the execution of playbooks. Ansible provides several ways to define and use variables:

- **Host Variables:** Variables can be associated with individual hosts in your inventory, allowing you to customize configurations for specific hosts.

- **Group Variables:** Variables can be set at the group level, affecting all hosts within a specific group. This simplifies the management of configurations for related hosts.

- **Facts:** Ansible gathers facts about remote hosts and makes them available as variables. These facts provide information about the host, such as its IP address, operating system, and more.

- **Registered Variables:** You can capture the output of tasks and store them in variables for later use in your playbook.

- **Set and Use Variables:** Ansible provides modules and playbooks for setting and using variables, allowing dynamic data manipulation during playbook execution.

## Defining Tasks in Ansible

In Ansible, tasks are the fundamental units of action within playbooks. While not equivalent to traditional methods or functions in programming, tasks perform specific actions on target hosts. Tasks are defined within playbooks and consist of modules and parameters. Key concepts for defining tasks in Ansible include:

- **Modules:** Ansible modules are pre-built units of code that perform specific tasks. For example, the `copy` module copies files, and the `service` module manages services on remote hosts.

- **Parameters:** Tasks can have parameters that configure how modules execute. These parameters customize the behavior of the module during task execution.

- **Playbooks:** Playbooks are Ansible's configuration files that define a series of tasks to be executed in a specific order. They provide a structure for organizing and sequencing tasks.

While Ansible doesn't use traditional programming constructs like methods, the playbook structure, modules, and variables provide a flexible way to define and execute tasks for infrastructure automation.

Remember that Ansible is not a traditional programming language but a tool for automation and configuration management.

# Roles in Ansible

## Introduction to Roles

In Ansible, roles provide a way to package automation content in a reusable and shareable format. Roles allow you to encapsulate a set of tasks, handlers, files, templates, and other Ansible artifacts into a single directory structure. They promote modularity, reusability, and a more organized way to structure playbooks.

## Structure of an Ansible Role

An Ansible role typically consists of the following directory structure:

```
roles/
    myrole/
        tasks/
            main.yml
        handlers/
            main.yml
        files/
        templates/
        vars/
            main.yml
        defaults/
            main.yml
        meta/
            main.yml
```

- **tasks:** This directory contains the main list of tasks to be executed by the role.

- **handlers:** This directory contains handlers, which may be used by this role or even anywhere outside this role.

- **files:** This directory contains any necessary files that need to be transferred to the target hosts.

- **templates:** This directory contains templates, which may be used by the role with the `template` module.

- **vars:** This directory contains variables that are used in the role.

- **defaults:** This directory contains default variables for the role.

- **meta:** This directory contains metadata about the role, including dependencies.

## Benefits of Using Roles

Roles offer several benefits in Ansible automation:

- **Reusability:** Roles can be reused across multiple playbooks, making it easier to maintain and manage automation tasks.

- **Simplification:** Roles help organize and simplify complex playbooks by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.

- **Abstraction:** Roles allow you to abstract the implementation details of tasks, making playbooks more readable and easier to understand.

- **Modularity:** Roles promote the development of modular automation content that can be shared and distributed within the Ansible community.

By leveraging roles effectively, you can streamline your Ansible automation workflows and create more maintainable and scalable infrastructure configurations.

# Conditionals and Loops in Ansible

## Conditionals

In Ansible, conditionals are used to control the flow of tasks based on specific conditions. Ansible provides a set of conditional statements that allow you to execute tasks selectively. Some common conditional statements in Ansible include:

- **when:** The `when` statement is used to specify a condition that determines whether a task should be executed or not. Tasks are executed only if the condition evaluates to true.

- **failed_when:** The `failed_when` statement is used to specify a condition that determines whether a task should be marked as failed or not based on the evaluation of the condition.

- **changed_when:** The `changed_when` statement is used to specify a condition that determines whether a task should be marked as changed or not based on the evaluation of the condition.

- **assert:** The `assert` statement is used to test a condition, and if the condition is false, the task fails.

## Loops

Loops in Ansible enable you to perform repetitive tasks or iterate over a list of items. Ansible provides various ways to implement loops in playbooks. Some common loop constructs in Ansible include:

- **with_items:** The `with_items` loop is used to iterate over a list of items and perform tasks for each item in the list.

- **loop:** The `loop` keyword allows you to iterate over a list of items or dictionaries. It provides a more flexible and powerful way to loop over data structures.

- **until:** The `until` statement is used to repeatedly execute a task until a specific condition is met.

- **retries:** The `retries` statement is used to specify the number of times a task should be retried if it fails.

By using conditionals and loops effectively, you can create dynamic and flexible Ansible playbooks that can handle various scenarios and automate complex tasks in your infrastructure.
