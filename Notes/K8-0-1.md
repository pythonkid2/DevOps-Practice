**Kube Proxy**:
- Maintains IP tables for routing network traffic within the Kubernetes cluster.

**Kubelet**:
- Responsible for creating and managing pods, ensuring that pods are always in the running state.

**Container Runtime**:
- Executes and manages the containers, ensuring they are running as expected within the pods.


| Component               | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API Server              | Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. Validates and configures data for API objects like pods, services, and replication controllers. |
| Scheduler               | Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements, quality of service, and other constraints.                                                    |
| ETCD                    | Consistent and highly-available key-value store. Stores configuration data, state data, and metadata for the Kubernetes cluster.                   |
| Controller Manager      | Runs controller processes to regulate the cluster state. Examples include ReplicaSet Controller, Endpoint Controller, Namespace Controller.       |
| Cloud Controller Manager| Integrates with the cloud provider's API to manage resources such as Load Balancers, Volumes, and Nodes.                                            |

Kubernetes Control Plane Architecture:
- **API Server**: Acts as the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and other constraints.
- **ETCD**: Consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
- **Controller Manager**: Runs controller processes that regulate the state of the cluster. Examples include ReplicationController, EndpointController, NamespaceController.
- **Cloud Controller Manager**: Integrates with the underlying cloud provider's API to manage resources like Load Balancers, Volumes, etc.

| Resource         | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Container        | A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run it. |
| Pod              | A group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources and a specification on how to run the containers. |
| Deployment       | A higher-level resource that manages Pods and provides declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets. |
| StatefulSet      | Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, with stable, unique network identifiers and persistent storage. |
| Load Balancer    | Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple Pods to ensure high availability and reliability.   |
| Service          | An abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.                |
| Ingress          | Manages external access to services in a cluster, typically providing HTTP and HTTPS routing.           |
| ConfigMap        | Storing non-confidential data in key-value pairs for Pods to consume.                                   |
| Secret           | Storing confidential data such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys securely in the cluster.       |

k8 service doesnt have enterprice level loa balancing , so we need ingress
