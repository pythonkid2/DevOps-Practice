## Caching

Caching is the process of storing a copy of data in a temporary or cache storage location so it can be accessed more quickly.

The AWS infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones (AZs). An AWS Region is a physical location in the world which has multiple Availability Zones ( AZs). These Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. Each Region is completely independent. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links.


Edge locations that are separate from Regions and are located at other locations. These Edge locations allow you to push your content near to your customers to give them a better experience on your platform.

# IAM

What is Identity and Access Management?

Identity and Access Management is a framework to ensure that the right people in your organization can access the right service or
as per their job.

IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS accounts and resources. The purpose of IAM is to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permission) to use resources.

You can provide secure access to multiple users to AWS resources with IAM. An AWS account is created with a single identity that gives you full access to the AWS account and its resources.

This identity is called the AWS account root user, and you use the email address and password you used to create the account.
