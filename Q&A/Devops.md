## Docker

Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create , deploy and run application using container

Q, Difference between expose & Publish

- EXPOSE is used in the Dockerfile to document the intended ports that the container should expose, while the -p or --publish option is used during runtime to map those container ports to specific ports on the host machine. The EXPOSE instruction alone doesn't make the container's ports accessible from the host; it's more like a hint to users or developers about the expected ports.

<img width="861" alt="image" src="https://github.com/pythonkid2/DevOps-Practice/assets/100591950/48e7ff22-c3a1-4771-9cae-810539af8140">

In a Dockerfile, the **CMD** instruction is used to specify the command that should be executed when the Docker container starts. It defines the default command for the container, which can be overridden by providing a command at the end of the `docker run` command.

The **ENTRYPOINT** instruction, on the other hand, is used to set the main command that is always executed when the container starts. Unlike `CMD`, the parameters are not ignored when providing a command to the `docker run` command.

Other important commands in a Dockerfile include:

- **FROM**: Specifies the base image for subsequent instructions. It is usually the first instruction in a Dockerfile.
- **RUN**: Executes commands in a new layer and creates a new image. This is used to install packages, run scripts, or perform any other actions during the build process.
- **COPY**: Copies files or directories from the build context into the container's own filesystem at a specified location.
- **ADD**: Similar to COPY, but it also supports URLs and automatically unpacks local tar files.
- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
- **EXPOSE**: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
- **ENV**: Sets the environment variable to a specific value inside the container.
- **ARG**: Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the `docker build` command using the `--build-arg` flag.
- **VOLUME**: Creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from the native host or other containers.
- **USER**: Sets the user name or UID to use when running the image.
- **HEALTHCHECK**: Tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working.

```
# Use an official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose a port (if your app listens on a specific port)
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run your Node.js application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]

```

In this example:

We use the official Node.js 14 image as the base image.
We set the working directory to /usr/src/app in the container.
We copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory and install dependencies.
We copy the rest of the application code to the working directory.
We expose port 3000 (you can adjust this based on your application).
We define the command to run the Node.js application (node app.js).

What is the Difference between **container** and **image**

**Image**:
An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. It is essentially a snapshot of a Docker container.

Images are read-only templates used to create Docker containers. They can be built from a Dockerfile using the docker build command or pulled from a registry using the docker pull command.

Images are used as the basis for creating containers. They can be versioned and distributed to other systems or users.

**Container:**
A container is a runtime instance of an imageâ€”basically, a running process isolated from the host and other containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient, allowing applications to be easily deployed and run consistently in various environments. Each container is created from a specific image and represents a running instance of that application, providing an isolated environment for running the application. 

In summary, images are the blueprints used to create containers, while containers are the actual runtime instances of those images. Containers provide a consistent environment for running applications, and images provide a way to package and distribute software with all its dependencies.

**Types of Docker Networks**

Reference: [YouTube - Types of Docker Networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKFMS5C4CG0)

Docker provides several types of networks to facilitate communication between containers and the outside world, each catering to different use cases. Here's an overview of the various types of Docker networks:

1. **Bridge Network**: This default network enables communication between containers on the same Docker daemon host. Containers on this network communicate via IP addresses and can connect to external networks using NAT (Network Address Translation).

2. **Host Network**: Containers using the host network mode share the network namespace with the Docker host. This eliminates network isolation from the host and allows the container to use the host's network directly, beneficial for performance-critical applications.

3. **Overlay Network**: This network type facilitates communication between containers across multiple Docker daemons. It's particularly useful for container orchestration, enabling seamless communication between containers across different hosts or cloud providers.

4. **Macvlan Network**: Macvlan assigns a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on the network. This allows containers direct access to external networks without encapsulation.

5. **None Network**: Containers on the none network have no access to external networks, only communicating with the Docker host. It's ideal for scenarios requiring complete container isolation from the network.

6. **Custom Networks**: Docker allows the creation of custom networks with specific configurations, providing flexibility and control over the networking environment for containers.

7. **IPvlan**: This Docker network driver creates multiple virtual network interfaces within a parent interface, enabling containers to have unique MAC and IP addresses while sharing the underlying physical network. It ensures network isolation and efficient resource utilization among containers.



**what does docker buid command do & build vs run command**
The docker build command is used to build Docker images from a Dockerfile. This process involves executing each instruction in the Dockerfile and creating a new layer for each instruction, ultimately producing a final image. The resulting image can be tagged and used to create containers.

The **docker run** command, on the other hand, is used to create and start a new container from a Docker image. When you run docker run, Docker takes the specified image and starts a container based on it. You can also provide additional options and configurations to the docker run command, such as exposing ports, setting environment variables, or specifying volumes to be mounted.

**docker create**
The docker create command is used to create a new container but does not start it. It returns a container ID that can be used in conjunction with other commands. This command is particularly useful when you want to set up a container without starting it immediately.
	
	docker create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

**what is docker hub**
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker that allows you to store and manage Docker images. It provides a centralized resource for container image discovery, distribution, and change management. Docker Hub offers the following key features:

**Image Repositories**: It enables you to store and manage your Docker images, either publicly or privately.

**Collaboration and Sharing**: Docker Hub facilitates collaboration by allowing users to share Docker images with their team members or the broader community.

**Automated Builds**: It provides the functionality to automatically build Docker images from source code repositories, making it easier to manage the continuous integration and deployment process.

**Webhooks and APIs**: Docker Hub offers webhooks and APIs that can be integrated with other tools and services, enabling you to automate various processes related to your Docker images.

**User Access Control**: It allows you to manage user access and permissions for private repositories, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive images.

**Official Images**: Docker Hub hosts a collection of official images that are curated and maintained by Docker, ensuring that users have access to trusted and reliable base images for their containers.


**Virtualization and Docker Containerization**

Virtualization:

- Creation of virtual versions of hardware, operating systems, and network resources.
- Enables running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.
- Each virtual machine runs its own operating system, isolated from others.

Docker Containerization:

- Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
- Containers package applications and their dependencies, running on any Linux server.
- Containers share the host system's operating system kernel, making them lightweight and fast.

Differences:

- Virtualization creates multiple virtual machines, while containerization isolates applications within a single operating system.
- Virtual machines emulate full-fledged computers, while containers share the host's operating system kernel.
- Virtual machines consume more resources and have slower start times compared to containers.

Similarities:

- Both provide isolation for running applications in contained environments.
- Both contribute to efficient resource utilization by enabling multiple applications to run on one physical machine.

## Ansible
1, What is configuration Mangement

Configuration management (CM) is essentially a practice for keeping computer systems, including servers, applications, and network devices, in a desired state. 

2, Ansible is a strong choice for configuration management due to its:
written in python, strong comminity, yamal is the  script language 

  Simplicity: Easy-to-learn YAML language.
  Agentless: No need to install software on managed systems.

3, Can you write an Ansible Playbook to install httpd service
and get it running ?

```
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd package
      # Adjust 'name' for your package manager (e.g., apt, dnf)
      package:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Enable httpd service on boot
      service:
        name: httpd
        enabled: yes

    - name: Start httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```

4, What is Ansible Dynamic Inventory ?

Ansible dynamic inventory automatically grabs your managed host list from external sources (cloud, CMDB) in real-time. This means no more manual updates, keeping your playbooks running on the latest and most accurate infrastructure.

It's like having a self-updating shopping list for your Ansible playbooks!

5, What is Ansible Galaxy command and why is it used

The Ansible Galaxy command, ansible-galaxy, is your tool for managing roles and collections in Ansible. It lets you:

- Install: Download roles and collections from the Ansible Galaxy website.
- Remove: Uninstall roles and collections from your system.
- List: See what roles and collections are already installed.
- Search: Find specific roles and collections on the Galaxy website.

Think of it as an app store for Ansible, where you can find pre-built tools (roles and collections) to automate various tasks, saving you time and effort.

6, What are handlers in Ansible and why are they used ?

Ansible handlers are special tasks that only run when specifically triggered by other tasks in your playbook. They are commonly used for actions that should only happen when a change is made, such as:

- Restarting a service after its configuration file is updated.
- Notifying administrators about successful or failed tasks.

### Why use handlers?
- Efficiency: They prevent unnecessary actions from running if no changes occur, improving performance.
- Idempotency: They ensure tasks only run when needed, maintaining a consistent state across multiple runs.

7, Ansible Protocol?

ssh for linux
winrm for windows

## Advantages of Ansible

Ansible offers several significant benefits for automating infrastructure and application management:

**Q: What are some of the key advantages of using Ansible?**

* **Cost-effective Solution:** As an open-source project, Ansible offers a cost-effective solution for automation tasks. Users can avoid significant financial investments associated with proprietary automation tools.

## Ansible Inventory and Playbooks

**Q: What is an inventory in Ansible, and how does it work?**

**A:** The inventory is a crucial file in Ansible that contains a list of systems and groups. Ansible uses the inventory to identify and target specific systems for automation tasks.

* **Hosts File:** Within the inventory file, individual entries for each host are specified with their details, such as hostname, IP address, and any additional variables.
* **Print Total Number of Hosts:** To view the total number of hosts in your inventory, you can use the `ansible-inventory --list` command or simply examine the contents of the inventory file.

**Q: What are handlers in Ansible?**

**A:** A handler represents a named list of tasks in Ansible. These tasks are triggered automatically when specific conditions are met or events occur within other tasks in a playbook.

**Q: What are Ansible roles, and why are they useful?**

**A:** Roles are a core concept in Ansible that enable users to group related tasks and configurations into reusable modules. These modules can then be included and referenced across different playbooks, promoting:

* **Code Reusability:** Roles prevent repetitive code and encourage the sharing of common automation tasks across various playbooks.
* **Modularity:** Roles enable the decomposition of complex automation tasks into well-defined and independent modules, improving overall organization and maintainability.
* **Scalability:** By using roles, users can easily manage and scale their automation workflows by modifying or adding new roles without affecting other parts of the codebase.

**Q: When should I use playbooks and when should I use roles?**

**A:** Playbooks are the primary unit of automation in Ansible. They define specific tasks and configurations that need to be executed on targeted systems.

* **Playbooks:** Use playbooks when you have a set of instructions or configurations specific to a particular environment or deployment scenario. They are ideal for defining and executing complete automation workflows for tasks like provisioning a new server, installing specific software, or configuring cloud resources.
* **Roles:** Use roles to create reusable and modular components containing common automation tasks or configurations. These roles can then be referenced and included within various playbooks, promoting code reusability and facilitating the construction of larger, more complex automation workflows.

By understanding the concepts of inventory, handlers, roles, and their appropriate use, you can effectively design and implement automation tasks for various infrastructure and application management scenarios using Ansible.


### Role example

To create an Ansible role for managing a simple Nginx configuration, you can follow the example below. Ansible roles are typically used to organize and manage tasks, handlers, variables, and other resources related to a specific component or application.

Here is an example of an Ansible role structure for managing Nginx configuration:

1. Create the role directory structure:
```bash
ansible-galaxy init nginx_role
```

2. Update the directory structure:
```
nginx_role/
â”œâ”€â”€ defaults
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ files
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nginx.conf
â”œâ”€â”€ handlers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ meta
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.yml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

3. Update the `tasks/main.yml` file with the tasks to configure Nginx:
```yaml
---
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present

- name: Copy Nginx configuration file
  copy:
    src: files/nginx.conf
    dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  notify: Restart Nginx
```

4. Update the `files/nginx.conf` file with your Nginx configuration.

5. Update the `handlers/main.yml` file with the handler to restart Nginx:
```yaml
---
- name: Restart Nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted
```

6. Update the `meta/main.yml` file with the role metadata:
```yaml
---
dependencies: []
```

7. Use the role in your playbook by including it in the `roles` section:
```yaml
---
- name: Playbook with Nginx role
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  roles:
    - nginx_role
```

By organizing tasks, files, and handlers related to Nginx configuration into a role, you can easily reuse and maintain this configuration across multiple playbooks. Roles provide a structured way to manage the configuration of specific components or applications in Ansible.

## Terraform

#### Use of Terraform Plan and Apply Command
- `terraform plan` is used to create an execution plan, while `terraform apply` is used to apply the changes.

#### Terraform
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used to build, change, and version infrastructure efficiently and safely.
  
<img width="562" alt="image" src="https://github.com/pythonkid2/DevOps-Practice/assets/100591950/d4c76687-ddc3-4827-8961-c45974864bfa">

**Terraform state file**

A Terraform state file is a file that stores information about the resources that Terraform manages. It is used by Terraform to track which resources exist, their attributes, and their relationships to other resources.

Here is a short summary of the key points:
- Terraform needs to store state to track which resources exist and their attributes, to track the relationships between resources, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.
- Best practices for managing Terraform state include storing it in a remote location, backing it up regularly, using version control, and being careful when sharing it with others.

## Terraform advantages

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your infrastructure as code. It has a number of advantages over traditional methods of managing infrastructure, including:

- **Consistency:** Terraform uses a high-level configuration language to define your infrastructure, which means that you can specify the desired state of your infrastructure in a consistent and predictable way. This helps to reduce errors and ensure that your infrastructure is always configured correctly.

- **Reusability:** You can define reusable modules in Terraform, which can be used to create and manage complex infrastructure components. This can save you time and effort, and help you to ensure that your infrastructure is consistent and well-organized.

- **Portability:** Terraform can be used to manage infrastructure on a variety of cloud providers, as well as on-premises. This gives you the flexibility to choose the right platform for your needs, without having to lock yourself into a particular vendor.

- **Collaboration:** Terraform stores its configuration in human-readable files, which makes it easy to collaborate with other engineers on your infrastructure projects. You can also use version control to track changes to your configuration and to roll back to previous versions if necessary.

- **Automation:** Terraform can be used to automate the deployment and management of your infrastructure. This can help you to save time and effort, and to reduce the risk of human error.

In addition to these advantages, Terraform is also a very active and well-supported project. There is a large community of Terraform users and contributors, and there are many resources available to help you get started with Terraform and to learn how to use it effectively.

## Benefits of using Terraform

- **Improved consistency:** Terraform helps to ensure that your infrastructure is always configured correctly by defining its desired state in a consistent and predictable way.

- **Reduced errors:** Terraform can help to reduce errors by automating the deployment and management of your infrastructure.

- **Increased efficiency:** Terraform can help you to save time and effort by automating repetitive tasks, such as creating and destroying resources.

- **Enhanced collaboration:** Terraform makes it easy to collaborate with other engineers on your infrastructure projects by storing its configuration in human-readable files.

- **Improved compliance:** Terraform can help you to improve compliance by ensuring that your infrastructure is always configured in accordance with your organization's policies.

**terraform verify**

The **terraform verify** command is used to validate the syntax and internal consistency of a Terraform configuration. It does this by reading the Terraform configuration and checking for errors, such as:

- Invalid resource type names or attribute names
- Invalid attribute values
- Duplicate resource definitions
- Circular resource dependencies

**provider in Terraform**

A provider in Terraform is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with a specific infrastructure platform or service. Providers are responsible for implementing the resource types and data sources that Terraform can use to manage infrastructure.

There are many different providers available, including providers for popular cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, as well as providers for other infrastructure platforms like Kubernetes and VMware. 


**What is lock.hcl in Terraform?**

The lock.hcl file is a dependency lock file that tracks the specific versions of Terraform providers and modules that are required to run a Terraform configuration. Terraform automatically creates and updates the lock file each time you run the terraform init command.

**Why is lock.hcl important?**

The lock file is important because it ensures that everyone who is working on a Terraform configuration is using the same versions of the providers and modules. This helps to prevent conflicts and errors.

**When should I use lock.hcl?**

You should use the lock.hcl file whenever possible, especially if you are collaborating with other people on a Terraform configuration. The lock file will help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that your configuration is consistent and reproducible.

## Git

**Source Code Management**
Source Code Management (SCM) is a broader term encompassing the management of changes to any kind of information source, not just software source code. It involves tracking and controlling changes to documents, programs, and other information assets. 

* **What is a Version Control System (VCS)?**
    * A VCS is used to manage and track changes to a project's source code over time. It enables collaboration among developers, maintains a history of changes, and facilitates the management of different versions of the codebase.

* **What is the difference between a Centralized and a Distributed Version Control System?**
    * A Centralized VCS has a single server that stores all versions of the files, whereas a Distributed VCS allows each user to have a complete copy of the repository, enabling them to work independently and facilitating easier collaboration without a central server.

* **Why is Git a popular choice for version control?**
    * Git is popular due to its distributed nature, speed, and efficiency in managing large projects. Its ability to handle branching and merging effectively, along with its robust set of tools for managing repositories, makes it a preferred choice for both small and large development teams.

* **What is Git?**
    * Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously. It tracks the changes made to files, enabling collaboration, and provides a mechanism for version control.

* **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**
    * Git is a version control system that is used to manage and track changes in files. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers additional features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.

* **What is a Git repository?**
    * A Git repository is a storage location where a Git project's files and their complete history are kept. It contains all the files, data, and metadata necessary to track the changes made to the project over time.

**git status**

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

* **How do you create a new Git repository?**
    * To create a new Git repository, you can use the `git init` command in the root directory of your project. This initializes a new Git repository and allows you to start tracking changes in your project files.

**git log**

The git log command is used to display the commit history in the repository. It shows the commit logs starting from the latest commit, allowing you to view information such as commit hashes, author details, dates, and commit messages. Here's an example of how to use it: $ **git log**

git log using various options. For example, you can use options like **--oneline** to display each commit on a single line or **--graph** to visualize the commit history as a graph.

* **What is a commit in Git?**
    * A commit in Git is a record of the changes made to a repository. It represents a snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and contains information about the changes made, such as the author, timestamp, and a commit message.

* **How do you create a new branch in Git?**

```
    	git branch <branch_name>
```
After creating the branch, you can switch to the newly created branch using the following command: 
```
	git checkout <branch_name>
```	
Alternatively, you can combine both commands into one using the -b flag to create and switch to the new branch in a single step: 
```
 git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

### Collaboration with Git and GitHub

* **What is a pull request in GitHub?**
    * A pull request used to fetch the changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch. It is essentially a combination of git fetch and git merge. When you run git pull, it automatically fetches the changes from the remote branch and merges them into your current local branch.
            
            git pull <remote>        git fetch <remote>

* **How do you merge a branch in Git?**

The git merge command in Git is used to integrate changes from one branch into another. It combines multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. 

    * To merge a branch in Git, you can use the command `git merge <branch_name>`. This command integrates the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

* **What is the difference between 'git pull' and 'git fetch'?**
    * `git pull` fetches the changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch, while `git fetch` only fetches the changes from the remote repository but does not automatically merge them. This allows you to review the changes before merging them into your branch.

* **How do you revert a commit in Git?**
    * To revert a commit in Git, you can use the command `git revert <commit_hash>`. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit while keeping a record of the reversal in the commit history.

### Advanced Git Concepts

**Git stash**

`Git stash` is a command in Git that allows you to temporarily store your changes without committing them. This can be particularly useful when you need to switch branches or if you want to save changes for later without committing them to your repository.

Here's how it works:

- When you run `git stash`, Git will stash away your changes and revert your working directory to match the HEAD commit.
- You can later reapply your changes by using `git stash apply` or `git stash pop`.
  - `git stash apply` will reapply the most recent stash, leaving it in the stash list for potential later use.
  - `git stash pop` will reapply the most recent stash and then remove it from the stash list.

* **What is the purpose of 'git merge' and how do you handle merge conflicts?**
    * 'git merge' integrates changes from one branch into another. Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences between branches. Resolving merge conflicts involves manually editing the affected files to incorporate the desired changes and then committing the resolved files.

* **Explain the use of 'git stash' and 'git rebase' in Git.**
    * 'git stash' is used to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to work on something else. 'git rebase' is used to apply changes from one branch to another. It allows you to


Rebasing:
	Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It allows you to maintain a cleaner, more linear project history. When you rebase a branch onto another, Git moves the base of the branch to a different point. This can be useful for integrating the latest changes from a master branch into a feature branch before merging it back.
	
	git rebase <base_branch>: Rebase the current branch onto the specified base branch.
	git rebase -i <base_branch>: Interactive rebase that allows you to edit, squash, or reorder commits during the rebase process.

Reverting:
	Reverting in Git refers to the act of creating a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit. Unlike reset, which rewrites the commit history, revert creates a new commit that effectively reverses the specified commit's changes while preserving the commit history. Reverting is a safer option when you want to undo changes that have already been pushed to a remote repository without altering the commit history.
	
	git revert <commit_hash>: Create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.
	git revert HEAD: Revert the most recent commit.
	git revert <commit_hash1> <commit_hash2>: Revert multiple specific commits.

Resetting:
	Resetting in Git is a powerful command that allows you to undo changes by moving the current branch to a specific commit. It can be used to alter the commit history, but it should be used with caution, especially when working with shared repositories. There are different modes of resetting, such as soft, mixed, and hard, each of which affects the staging area and working directory differently.
	
	git reset --soft <commit_hash>: Move the current branch to the specified commit, preserving changes in the working directory and staging area.
	git reset --mixed <commit_hash>: Reset the staging area to match the specified commit while preserving changes in the working directory.
	git reset --hard <commit_hash>: Discard all changes and reset the working directory to match the specified commit.


Walk me through the process of collaborating with others using local and remote repositories in Git and GitHub.
	Collaborating with others involves pushing your changes to a remote repository on GitHub, pulling changes from the remote repository, resolving any conflicts, and pushing the resolved changes back to the remote repository. GitHub's pull request feature facilitates code review and discussion before merging changes into the main branch.

+++
	
1. Different Types of Git Workflow Models:

Centralized Workflow:
	In the centralized workflow, all developers work on a single branch, typically the 'master' branch. Each developer clones the central repository, makes changes locally, and then pushes the changes to the central server. It's a simple workflow suitable for small teams and small projects where the complexity of branching is not necessary.

Feature Branch Workflow:
	In the feature branch workflow, each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch. Developers create a new branch for each feature, work on it independently, and then merge it back into the main branch upon completion. This model allows for parallel development, enabling developers to work on multiple features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

Gitflow Workflow:
	Gitflow is a branching model that defines a strict branching structure designed for larger projects. It involves maintaining separate branches for feature development, release preparation, and hotfixes. It promotes a systematic approach to version control, ensuring a smooth and controlled release process with clearly defined stages for feature development and bug fixing.

2. Git Hooks:

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after certain events, such as committing, pushing, or merging. They allow you to automate tasks and enforce certain actions in the Git workflow, ensuring consistency and preventing errors.

3. Examples of Git Hooks and Their Practical Applications:

Pre-commit Hook:
	A pre-commit hook is triggered before the commit is created. It can be used to run automated checks, such as code linting or formatting, to ensure that all committed code meets predefined standards.

Pre-push Hook:
	The pre-push hook runs before the push operation to a remote repository. It can be used to perform tests, ensuring that the pushed code doesn't break any critical functionality and adheres to the project's guidelines.

Post-commit Hook:
	The post-commit hook executes after a commit is completed. It can be used to trigger actions like sending notifications or updating external services to reflect the latest changes made to the repository.

4. Best Practices for Committing, Branching, and Merging in Git:
Committing Best Practices:
	Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made in the commit. Commit small and logical changes frequently rather than large, infrequent commits. Avoid committing incomplete or work-in-progress changes.

Branching Best Practices:
	Create feature branches for new development work and bug fixes. Use meaningful branch names that reflect the purpose of the development work. Regularly merge changes from the main branch into feature branches to keep them up to date.

Merging Best Practices:
	Test your changes locally before merging them into the main branch. Resolve any conflicts that arise during the merge process. Use merge commits or rebase to maintain a clean and linear project history. Communicate with your team before performing any significant merges to ensure a smooth integration of changes.

## Jenkins

https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/blob/main/Interview_Questions.md

## Polling the SCM in Jenkins

Polling the SCM (Software Configuration Management) in Jenkins refers to the process of periodically checking the source code repository for any changes. Jenkins can be configured to check the repository at a specified interval, and if changes are detected, it triggers a build process.

To enable polling the SCM in Jenkins, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Jenkins dashboard and select the desired project.
2. Click on "Configure" to access the project configuration.
3. Look for the "Build Triggers" section.
4. Check the option that allows polling the SCM. You may need to specify the frequency of the polling.
5. Save the configuration.

Once enabled, Jenkins will check the source code repository at the specified interval. If it detects any changes, it will trigger a build process automatically. This can be an effective way to ensure that your project is continuously built and tested whenever there are updates in the source code repository.

## How to Add Slave Connection in Jenkins

### Set up the Slave Node:

- Ensure that the slave machine is reachable from the Jenkins master.
- Install Java and the necessary tools on the slave machine if they are not already installed.
- Ensure that the slave machine has the required network access to the Jenkins master.

### Configure Jenkins Master:

1. Log in to your Jenkins dashboard as an administrator.
2. Click on "Manage Jenkins" on the left-hand side.
3. Select "Manage Nodes and Clouds."
4. Click on "New Node" or "New Agent" to create a new node.
5. Provide a node name and select the option for a permanent agent.
6. Enter the necessary details such as the number of executors, remote root directory, labels, and usage.
7. Choose the appropriate launch method, such as via Java Web Start or SSH.
8. Enter the specific details required for the selected launch method.

### Save Configuration and Connect:

- Save the configuration of the node.
- Jenkins will provide you with a command or instructions on how to launch the agent on the slave machine. Execute this command on the slave machine to connect it to the Jenkins master.

### Verify the Connection:

- Once the connection is established, the slave node should appear in the Jenkins dashboard under "Nodes" or "Agents."
- You can then use this slave node to distribute build and test jobs from the Jenkins master.

## A Multi-Branch Pipeline

A **multi-branch pipeline** project in Jenkins is a type of project that allows you to implement different Jenkins pipelines for multiple branches of your source code repository. It automatically detects branches in the repository and creates a pipeline for each branch. This feature is particularly useful for managing and automating the build and test process for projects with multiple branches, such as feature branches, release branches, and hotfix branches.

With a multi-branch pipeline project, you can:

- Automatically detect new branches in your repository and create corresponding pipelines.
- Build, test, and deploy each branch separately, enabling isolated development and testing environments.
- Track the build and test status of each branch independently.
- Merge changes back to the main branch (e.g., master) once the development on a branch is complete and tested.


## How to Add Custom Plugin in Jenkins

### Download the Plugin:

1. Locate the plugin you wish to install from the Jenkins Plugin Index or from a reliable source. Ensure that the plugin is compatible with your Jenkins version.

### Install the Plugin:

1. Log in to your Jenkins dashboard as an administrator.
2. Click on "Jenkins" at the top left to go to the dashboard.
3. In the left sidebar, select "Manage Jenkins."
4. Click on "Manage Plugins."
5. Navigate to the "Available" tab.
6. Find the plugin you want to install, select the checkbox next to its name, and click "Install without restart" or "Download now and install after restart."

### Restart Jenkins (If Required):

If the plugin installation requires a Jenkins restart, a notification will appear. Follow the instructions to restart Jenkins.

### Configure the Plugin:

Once the plugin is installed, you may need to configure it based on your requirements. Check the plugin documentation or the Jenkins wiki for instructions on how to configure the specific plugin you have installed.

## Post-Build Actions in Jenkins

In Jenkins, post-build actions are the additional operations or tasks that you can configure to be executed after the main build step has completed. Some common post-build actions in Jenkins include:

- **Archive the artifacts**
- **Publish JUnit test result report**
- **Triggering other projects**
- **Sending email notifications**
- **Post to Slack or other communication platforms**
- **Publishing build reports and metrics**
- **Executing shell scripts or batch commands**


## Plugins in Jenkins

**Plugins in Jenkins** are software components that extend the functionality of the Jenkins automation server. They allow you to integrate additional features and tools into your Jenkins environment, enabling you to customize and enhance your CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines.

## Available Annotations in Jenkins

Jenkins supports various annotations and directives that can be used within Jenkinsfiles, which are used to define Jenkins pipelines. These annotations and directives provide instructions to Jenkins on how to execute the pipeline stages and steps. Some of the commonly used annotations in Jenkins are as follows:

- **agent:** Specifies the agent to use for running the pipeline. For example, `agent any` indicates that the pipeline can be run on any available agent.
- **options:** Provides various configuration options for the pipeline, such as timeouts, build discard policies, and more.
- **parameters:** Defines input parameters that can be used to trigger the pipeline manually or to provide user-specified values during the pipeline execution.
- **stages:** Defines the different stages of the pipeline, allowing you to organize the pipeline steps into logical groups.
- **steps:** Represents the individual steps to be executed within a stage, such as building, testing, or deploying the application.
- **environment:** Defines the environment variables that should be available to the steps within the pipeline.
- **post:** Specifies actions that should be performed after the stages have been executed, such as sending notifications, archiving artifacts, or triggering other pipelines.
- **when:** Allows conditional execution of certain stages or steps based on specific conditions, such as the result of a previous step or a predefined variable.

## Maven

Advantages of Maven:

- Simplified dependency management
- Consistent and automated build process
- Standardization of project structure
- Extensive plugin ecosystem
- Facilitation of reproducible builds
- Seamless integration with CI/CD tools
- Customization and extensibility opportunities

**Maven commands**

Maven is a powerful build automation tool primarily used for Java projects. It simplifies and standardizes the build process, manages project dependencies, and provides a uniform build system. Below are some commonly used Maven commands:

- `mvn clean`: Cleans the project by deleting the target directory and removing all compiled class files and resources.
- `mvn compile`: Compiles the source code of the project.
- `mvn test`: Runs the unit tests for the project.
- `mvn package`: Packages the compiled code of the project into a distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file.
- `mvn install`: Installs the project's package into the local repository, making it available for other projects that need to use it as a dependency.
- `mvn deploy`: Deploys the built artifact to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
- `mvn site`: Generates the project's website documentation.
- `mvn archetype:generate`: Generates a new project from an existing template, known as an archetype.
- `mvn dependency:tree`: Displays the project's dependency tree.
- `mvn help`: Displays help information on Maven commands and options.


**mvn package** : This is a Maven build lifecycle phase, specifically the package phase. When you run mvn package, Maven will execute all phases up to and including the package phase. In this phase, Maven will create the JAR or WAR file of your project based on the configuration in the project's POM (Project Object Model) file. This does not include the installation of the artifact into the local repository or a remote repository.

**The POM (Project Object Model)** file
Essential configuration file used in Apache Maven-based projects. It is an XML file that contains information about the project and configuration details to build the project. The POM file provides details about the project's structure, dependencies, build settings, and other essential information required for Maven to build the project correctly.

key components of POM.xml

**Project information** : This includes the project's group ID, artifact ID, version, and other descriptive information.
**Dependencies** : These are the external libraries or modules required by the project.
**Build settings** : This includes information about plugins, goals, and other configurations for building the project.
**Repositories** : These are the locations where Maven can look for dependencies needed to build the project.

**The Maven build and Maven package**
	
 The Maven build and Maven package commands are both used in the context of building and packaging a Maven project, but they serve different purposes:

**Maven Build** Command: The mvn build command is a generic command that is used to build the project. It triggers the default lifecycle up to the package phase. This means it will compile the source code, run any tests, and package the compiled code into a JAR, WAR, or any other format defined in the project configuration.

**Maven Package** Command: The mvn package command is specifically used to execute the package phase of the Maven build lifecycle. This phase is responsible for taking the compiled code and packaging it into its distributable format, such as a JAR, WAR, or EAR file, depending on the type of the project.

**In summary, while the mvn build command is more generic and triggers the build process up to the package phase, the mvn package command specifically executes the package phase to create the distributable package as defined by the project configuration.**

**Test Configuration**: TestNG allows the configuration of test suites and provides flexibility in defining suite parameters, test dependencies, parallel execution, and more.

**launch a browser using Selenium in Java**
To launch a browser using Selenium in Java, you need to have the appropriate **Selenium WebDriver** libraries and the corresponding driver executable for the browser you intend to automate. Here's a basic example using the Chrome browser:

**Download the Selenium WebDriver** for Java from the Selenium website and add it to your Java project's build path.

**Download the ChromeDriver executable from the ChromeDriver website** and place it in a location accessible by your Java project.

	Here's a basic code snippet for launching the Chrome browser using Selenium WebDriver in Java:

```
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class SeleniumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set the path to the ChromeDriver executable
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path_to_chromedriver_executable");

        // Create an instance of the ChromeDriver
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        // Open a website
        driver.get("https://www.example.com");

        // Perform any required operations

        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
	}
}
```

**WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();**

By using this line of code, you can create a new instance of the ChromeDriver, which then allows you to control the Chrome browser through your Java code using Selenium WebDriver.

**why driver in selenium** 

In Selenium, the term "driver" refers to the software component that facilitates the communication between your test script and the browser. It acts as a bridge between the automation script and the browser's native support for automation (such as Chrome, Firefox, or others). The driver is a crucial part of the Selenium framework as it enables you to control the browser, navigate to URLs, and interact with web elements.

## Kubernetes

## Kubernetes Services: Types and More

This document covers various aspects of Kubernetes, including service types, etcd, kubectl, and key concepts like Kube-proxy, Ingress, Kubelet, and Control Plane components.

### Services in Kubernetes

**Q: What are the different types of services in Kubernetes?**

A: Kubernetes offers several service types to expose applications within a cluster or externally:

1. **ClusterIP (default):** Exposes the service internally within the cluster, only accessible by other pods using the service's DNS name within the cluster.

2. **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port, making it accessible from outside the cluster using the node's IP address and the service's port number.

3. **LoadBalancer:** Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple backend services or pods, typically requiring cloud provider support to create a load balancer that routes traffic to the service.

4. **ExternalName:** Maps the service to a predefined external DNS name, allowing you to link to an existing service outside the cluster.

### Understanding etcd

**Q: What is etcd and what are its key features?**

A: etcd is an essential component in many distributed systems, including Kubernetes. It's an open-source distributed key-value store that provides:

- **Simple API:** Easy to use and integrate into applications with a JSON-formatted HTTP API.
- **Security:** Supports secure communication using SSL/TLS and enforces access control through RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
- **Reliability:** Ensures data consistency through a distributed consensus algorithm (Raft) for a highly available replicated log.
- **Performance:** Built for handling a high volume of requests with low latency.
- **Strong Community Backing:** Benefits from active development and support from the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) community.

### Using kubectl

**Q: What is kubectl and what does it do?**

A: kubectl is the command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It allows you to:

- View and manage cluster resources (e.g., pods, deployments, services).
- Run commands against the cluster API server.
- Troubleshoot and debug cluster issues.

### Kube-proxy vs. Ingress

**Q: What's the difference between Kube-proxy and Ingress?**

A: Both are crucial for exposing services in Kubernetes, but they serve different purposes:

- **Kube-proxy:** Runs on each node, managing network rules and ensuring communication between pods and services within the cluster. It's responsible for routing traffic based on service definitions.

- **Ingress:** Exposes HTTP and HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to services within. It acts as a single entry point, often requiring an external load balancer to forward traffic to the Ingress resource, which then routes it to the appropriate service based on configuration rules.

### Kubelet and Control Plane

**Q: What are Kubelet and the Control Plane in Kubernetes?**

A: **Kubelet:**

- Runs on each node in the cluster, acting as an agent.
- Manages the lifecycle of containers within Pods, ensuring they run as specified in pod definitions.
- Monitors container health and restarts failed containers.

**Control Plane:**

- Manages the overall state of the cluster.
- Schedules containers on nodes, performs rolling updates and rollbacks, and handles service discovery.
- Comprises several components:
    - API Server: Exposes the REST API for interacting with the cluster.
    - Scheduler: Assigns pods to nodes based on defined scheduling policies.
    - Controller Manager: Manages various cluster resources like deployments, replicasets, and services.
    - etcd: Stores cluster state data reliably using a distributed key-value store.

### Advantages of Using Kubernetes

**Q: What are the benefits of using Kubernetes?**

A: Kubernetes offers several advantages for managing containerized applications:

- **Scalability:** Easily scale applications up or down based on demand by adding or removing containers.
- **High Availability:** Ensures application availability by automatically load balancing traffic and rescheduling containers in case of node failures.
- **Improved Resource Utilization:** Optimizes resource allocation by assigning resources to containers based on their needs.
- **Simplified Deployment and Updates:** Streamlines application deployment and updates with minimal downtime.
- **Portability:** Deploy applications across various cloud providers and on-premises environments.
- **Large and Active Community:** Benefits from a vast community for support and knowledge sharing.

These are just some of the core concepts and functionalities of Kubernetes. Its use cases extend beyond what's covered here, making it a valuable tool for building, deploying, and managing modern containerized applications.

## Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) in Kubernetes

This document explains the concepts of Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in Kubernetes, their roles, and how they differ.

### Understanding PVs and PVCs

**Persistent Volumes (PVs)** and **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)** are crucial components in Kubernetes for managing storage of containerized applications. While both deal with persistent storage, they play distinct roles:

**Persistent Volume (PV):**

* **Definition:** A PV represents a **physical storage unit** (e.g., disk, host directory, cloud storage) that can be provisioned (created) by a cluster administrator. It exists independently of any particular Pod and embodies the actual storage resource.
* **Characteristics:**
    - Defined by a YAML or JSON manifest file, specifying details like capacity, access modes (read-only, read/write once, read/write many), and storage class (optional).
    - Can be provisioned manually by the administrator or dynamically using storage classes.
    - Can be bound to multiple PVCs at different times, but only one PVC can access it at a time (exclusive access).
* **Responsibility:** Managed by the administrator, who creates and configures PVs to provide different storage types and capacities.

**Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):**

* **Definition:** A PVC represents a **request for storage** by a Pod. It specifies the storage requirements (e.g., capacity, access modes) that a Pod needs without explicitly defining the underlying physical storage.
* **Characteristics:**
    - Also defined by a YAML or JSON manifest file, indicating the required storage size, access modes, and optionally, a storage class to match against available PVs.
    - Acts as a Pod's request for a PV that meets its specifications.
    - Can bind to a single PV at a time, forming a relationship between the Pod and the allocated storage resource.
* **Responsibility:** Used by application developers or users who specify the storage needs of their Pods through PVCs.

### Key Differences

| Feature        | Persistent Volume (PV)       | Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)      |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Role**         | Provides storage resources.   | Requests storage resources.        |
| **Created by**  | Cluster administrator.         | Application developer/user.       |
| **Specificity**  | Defines the actual storage.   | Defines the storage requirements.   |
| **Binding**     | Binds to multiple PVCs (at different times). | Binds to a single PV at a time.   |
| **Responsibility**| Admin manages provision and configuration. | User/developer specifies storage needs. |

### Use Cases

* **PVs:** Suitable for defining various storage types (e.g., local disks, cloud storage) with different access modes and capacity for different application needs.
* **PVCs:** Ideal for requesting the required storage resources for Pods, allowing developers to focus on application logic without worrying about managing the underlying storage details.

### Summary

PVs and PVCs work together to provide a flexible and manageable approach to persistent storage in Kubernetes deployments. PVs represent the physical storage resources, while PVCs act as the Pods' requests for those resources, facilitating a clear separation of concerns between storage management and application development.

## Stateful vs. Stateless Systems

This document explores the concepts of stateful and stateless systems, highlighting their characteristics, identification methods, and considerations for choosing between them.

### Stateful Systems

**Definition:** Stateful systems maintain their own state (data) across multiple requests or interactions. They remember past interactions and use that information to influence future behavior.

**Characteristics:**

* **Store data internally:** Typically in databases or persistent storage solutions.
* **Retain information:** About past user sessions, transactions, or application state.
* **Require state management:** May involve additional configuration or dedicated strategies.
* **Examples:** Shopping carts in e-commerce, database servers, session managers, personalized recommendation systems.

**Identification:**

* Look for systems that store and use data across requests or sessions.
* Check for persistent storage usage or dedicated databases.
* Observe if systems rely on past interactions to influence current behavior.

### Stateless Systems

**Definition:** Stateless systems treat each request independently, without retaining any information about past interactions. They do not store state internally and rely solely on the information provided in each request.

**Characteristics:**

* **Do not store data internally:** Each request is treated as a new, isolated event.
* **Operate on a request-by-request basis:** Do not rely on past interactions.
* **Generally simpler to scale:** Can be horizontally scaled by adding more instances.
* **Examples:** Web servers serving static content, API endpoints performing specific calculations, distributed file systems.

**Identification:**

* Look for systems that treat each request independently, without referencing past interactions.
* Verify that systems do not store data internally or rely on external state management solutions.
* Observe if the system's behavior remains consistent regardless of the request sequence.

### Choosing Between Stateful and Stateless Systems

The choice between stateful and stateless systems depends on your specific application requirements. Consider the following factors:

* **Data Persistence:** If your application needs to retain data across requests or sessions, a stateful system is necessary.
* **Scalability:** Stateless systems are generally easier to scale horizontally due to their simpler state management.
* **Complexity:** Stateful systems can be more complex to manage due to state management and potential consistency issues.

By understanding the characteristics and considerations of stateful and stateless systems, you can make informed decisions when designing and deploying your applications.


https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/service

#### Types of Services in Kubernetes
- **ClusterIP:** The default service type, which exposes the service internally within the cluster.
- **NodePort:** Exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port.
- **LoadBalancer:**  service that helps distribute incoming network traffic across multiple backend services or pods. 
- **ExternalName:** Maps the service to a pre-defined external DNS name.

The cluster IP port number in Kubernetes is a port number that is assigned to a Service.

**Node port** range - (default 30000-32767).

To print **running pods** in Kubernetes, 
```
kubectl get pods
```
number of running pods 
```
kubectl get pods -l status=Running | wc -l
```

A **NodePort service** in Kubernetes exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port. This means that the service will be accessible by the IP of any node on that particular port. NodePort service is the most straightforward way to expose a service from the Kubernetes cluster to the outside world.

**etcd**

**etcd** is an open-source distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data across a cluster of machines. It's often used in distributed systems for shared configuration and service discovery. Originally developed by CoreOS, etcd is now a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, and it is widely used in modern cloud-native environments and container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

Key features of etcd include:

1. **Simple**: etcd has a simple HTTP API with JSON-formatted requests and responses. It is easy to use and integrate into applications.

**kubectl**

kubectl is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for running commands against Kubernetes clusters.

#### Difference between Kubeproxy and Ingress

- **Kube Proxy:** A Kubernetes daemon that runs on each node and manages network rules for services.
- **Ingress:** A Kubernetes resource that allows you to expose HTTP and HTTPS traffic from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.

#### Kubelet
- Agent that runs on each node in the cluster, ensuring that containers are running in a Pod.

#### Control Plane
- Manages the Kubernetes cluster, including scheduling, scaling, and deploying containers. The control plane includes the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd.

#### API Server
- The Kubernetes API server is the front-end interface to the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes a REST API that clients can use to manage the cluster and its resources.

#### Advantages of Kubernetes

- Scalability, automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing, easy management, and efficient resource utilization.
  
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes makes it easy to scale applications up or down by adding or removing containers as needed. This can help to improve performance and reduce costs.
- **High availability**: Kubernetes automatically load balances traffic between containers and reschedules containers if a node fails. This helps to ensure that applications are always available, even if there are problems with the underlying infrastructure.
- **Improved resource utilization**: Kubernetes automatically allocates resources to containers based on their needs. This helps to improve resource utilization and reduce waste.
- **Easy deployment and updates**: Kubernetes makes it easy to deploy and update applications without downtime. This can help to improve productivity and reduce risk.
- **Portability**: Kubernetes applications can be deployed on a variety of cloud providers and on-premises. This gives you the flexibility to choose the right platform for your needs.
- **Community support**: Kubernetes has a large and active community of users and contributors. This means that there is a wealth of information and
support available to help you get started with Kubernetes and to troubleshoot problems.

_Here are some specific examples of how Kubernetes can be used to improve the performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of your applications:

Scale your applications up or down based on demand. If your application experiences a sudden increase in traffic, you can easily scale it up by adding more containers. Kubernetes will automatically distribute the traffic between the containers, so that your application remains responsive. When the traffic subsides, you can scale the application back down to save costs.
Improve the reliability of your applications. Kubernetes automatically detects and replaces failed containers. This means that your applications can continue to run even if there are problems with the underlying infrastructure.
Reduce the cost of running your applications. Kubernetes can help you to reduce the cost of running your applications by optimizing resource utilization. Kubernetes will automatically allocate resources to containers based on their needs. This means that you are not wasting resources on idle containers.

## Prometheus & Grafana

#### Types of Metrics in Prometheus
- Counters, Gauges, Histograms, and Summaries.


Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that is widely used for monitoring applications and microservices. It is known for its efficient data model and powerful query language. Prometheus primarily works based on time-series data, which are stored as metrics. These metrics can be classified into several types, including:

1. **Counter**: A monotonically increasing value that resets when the process restarts. It is often used to count the number of events or occurrences, such as the number of requests served.

2. **Gauge**: A value that can go up and down. It is typically used to represent values that can fluctuate, such as current CPU usage, memory usage, or the number of items in a queue.

3. **Histogram**: A series of buckets that represent the distribution of values in a set of samples. Histograms are used to track and record the distribution of values in a stream of data, such as request durations or response sizes.

4. **Summary**: Similar to a histogram, a summary also tracks the distribution of values in a stream of data. However, it provides a more accurate representation of the distribution's quantiles over time, making it useful for tracking percentiles of request durations, for instance.
