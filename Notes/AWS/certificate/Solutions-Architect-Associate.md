## ElasticBeanstalk

## ✅ **Elastic Beanstalk (EB)**

### 1. **What**

> AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that lets you **deploy, manage, and scale web applications** and services without managing the underlying infrastructure (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, etc.).

---

### 2. **Why (Use Cases)**

* Quickly deploy **web apps** using languages like Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Node.js, Go, Ruby, or Docker.
* Ideal for teams that want **managed infrastructure** with minimal setup.
* Auto handles **scaling, load balancing, health monitoring**, and patching.
* Supports **zero-downtime deployments** and easy rollbacks.

---

### 3. **How (Configuration)**

* Package your app (ZIP or WAR).
* Go to **Elastic Beanstalk Console** or use **EB CLI**.
* Create an **Environment**:

  * Choose platform (e.g., Python, Node.js).
  * Choose **Web server environment** (for HTTP apps) or **Worker environment** (for background jobs).
* EB automatically provisions:

  * **EC2 instances**
  * **Auto Scaling Group**
  * **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**
  * **CloudWatch alarms**
  * Optional: **RDS** DB instances

> You can customize environments using:

* `.ebextensions/` for config files
* Saved configurations
* Custom AMIs

---

### 4. **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* **Long boot time** if app installation is heavy → use **custom AMI** to preinstall.
* Limited control over low-level infrastructure (vs EC2 or ECS).
* Rolling deployments can **terminate old instances** → configure appropriately.
* No fine-grained IAM per container/app like in ECS/EKS.
* RDS lifecycle is **tied to environment** unless created separately.

---

### 5. **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* “**Quickly deploy web apps**” → Elastic Beanstalk
* “**Manage app without infra**” → EB
* “**Takes 45 mins to start, want 2 mins**” → Use **Custom AMI + Saved Configuration**
* Often compared with:

  * **OpsWorks** (Chef/Puppet config)
  * **CloudFormation** (infra as code)
  * **CodeDeploy** (custom deployments)
* “Fully managed service for deployment” → EB

## Trusted Advisor

## ✅ **AWS Trusted Advisor**

### 1. **What**

> AWS Trusted Advisor is an **online tool** that provides **real-time guidance** to help you **follow AWS best practices** in the areas of **cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance**, and **service limits**.

---

### 2. **Why (Use Cases)**

* **Optimize AWS costs** (e.g., detect idle EC2s, underutilized RIs).
* Improve **security posture** (e.g., check for open ports, MFA usage).
* Ensure **service limits** aren’t exceeded (e.g., EC2 instance limits).
* Improve **performance** and **availability** by identifying risks.
* Get proactive recommendations across your AWS resources.

---

### 3. **How (Configuration)**

* Go to **AWS Management Console** → Trusted Advisor.
* By default, **Core checks** are available to **all accounts**:

  * Service Limits
  * IAM Use
  * MFA on Root
  * Billing
* To access **full checks**, you need a support plan:

  * **Business or Enterprise support**
* Categories of checks:

  * **Cost Optimization**
  * **Performance**
  * **Security**
  * **Fault Tolerance**
  * **Service Limits**

You can also:

* **Export results to CSV**
* Use **AWS CLI** or **SDKs** to get check statuses
* Set up **notifications via CloudWatch + SNS**

---

### 4. **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* Full Trusted Advisor checks require **Business or Enterprise support**.
* Recommendations are **guidance only**, not enforced actions.
* Some checks **do not update in real time** (may be daily/weekly).
* Trusted Advisor **does not fix issues automatically**—you must act.

---

### 5. **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* “**Best practices guidance**” → Trusted Advisor
* “**Cost savings, security, fault tolerance**” → Trusted Advisor
* Only **Core checks available with Basic/Developer support**
* “**Which AWS tool checks for unused resources and security gaps**” → Trusted Advisor
* **NOT** to be confused with **Config (compliance tracking)** or **Inspector (vulnerability scanning)**

## AWS Cost Explorer

## ✅ **AWS Cost Explorer**

### 1. **What**

> AWS Cost Explorer is a **visualization tool** that allows you to **analyze, track, and forecast your AWS spending and usage** over time. It helps you understand where your costs are coming from and how they evolve.

---

### 2. **Why (Use Cases)**

* Monitor and **analyze your AWS costs** by service, linked account, region, or usage type.
* Identify **cost trends** and **spending spikes**.
* Track the impact of **Reserved Instances (RIs)** or **Savings Plans**.
* Forecast future spend based on historical usage.
* Share and **create reports** for budgeting or internal cost management.

---

### 3. **How (Configuration)**

* Go to **AWS Management Console** → Billing → **Cost Explorer**.
* Enable Cost Explorer (one-time setup; takes a few hours to populate data).
* Create custom reports:

  * Filter by **service**, **region**, **linked account**, **usage type**, etc.
  * Group by **resource tags**, **instance types**, or **linked accounts**.
* View:

  * **Daily, monthly, or custom time ranges**
  * **Forecasting** for future costs
* Export to **CSV**, schedule reports, or access programmatically via **AWS Cost Explorer API**.

---

### 4. **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* Cost Explorer does **not show real-time billing** (data is usually delayed by 24 hours).
* **Forecasting is only an estimate** based on past trends (not guaranteed).
* Cannot break down cost by **individual EC2 instance ID** unless detailed billing and tags are properly set up.
* **Tag-based filtering** only works if cost allocation tags are enabled.
* Not available in the **GovCloud** region.

---

### 5. **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* “**Visualize and track AWS costs over time**” → Cost Explorer
* “**Forecast AWS spending**” → Cost Explorer
* “**Which tool helps you analyze spending trends**” → Cost Explorer
* Not to be confused with:

  * **Billing Dashboard** – shows raw bills
  * **Budgets** – for alerting
  * **Trusted Advisor** – for recommendations

## IAM
---

## ✅ **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

### 1. **What**

> IAM is a **global AWS service** that allows you to **securely manage access** to AWS services and resources for users, groups, and applications.
> It provides **fine-grained permissions** to control who can do what in your AWS account.

---

### 2. **Why (Use Cases)**

* Create and manage **users, groups, and roles**.
* **Control access** to AWS services (e.g., S3, EC2) via **policies**.
* Enable **temporary access** using IAM roles for EC2, Lambda, etc.
* Enforce **MFA** and strong authentication.
* Enable **cross-account access** securely.

---

### 3. **How (Configuration)**

* Create **IAM users** for individuals who need AWS console or API access.
* Group users and assign **policies** to groups (e.g., AdminGroup).
* Create **IAM roles**:

  * For EC2, Lambda, etc., to securely call other AWS services.
  * For **cross-account access** or AWS services like CodeBuild, ECS tasks.
* Attach **inline or managed policies** (JSON-based).
* Use **IAM policy simulator** to test permissions.

---

### 4. **Common Pitfalls / Limits**

* IAM is **not region-specific** – it's global.
* By default, **new users have no permissions** until policies are attached.
* **Overly permissive policies** (e.g., `"Action": "*"` and `"Resource": "*"`) are risky.
* Avoid **using root user** except for account setup.
* **Roles are preferred** over long-term access keys for services.

---

### 5. **Exam Tips / Keywords**

* “**Control access to AWS resources**” → IAM
* “**Assign permissions using policies**” → IAM
* “**Temporary access to AWS resources**” → IAM Roles
* “**Cross-account access**” → IAM Roles + Trust Policy
* IAM is **free** (no extra cost)
* **MFA + IAM best practice** questions are common

## Auto Scaling Groups

# 🔹 Core Concepts

### **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

* Manages a **fleet of EC2 instances** across AZs.
* Ensures **min, max, desired capacity**.
* Works with **Launch Template / Launch Config**.
* Integrated with **ELB/ALB/NLB**, **CloudWatch**, **SNS**, **SQS**.

---

# 🔹 Scaling Policies (Exam Keywords)

1. **Manual Scaling**

   * You set Desired Capacity manually.
   * Simple but not automated.
   * Keyword: *manual intervention*.

---

2. **Dynamic Scaling** (automatic, triggered by CloudWatch)

   * **Target Tracking Scaling**

     * Like thermostat.
     * E.g., “Keep average CPU at 50%”.
     * Easiest to configure.
     * Exam keyword: *simplest / recommended / maintain metric at X*.
   * **Step Scaling**

     * Responds to **CloudWatch alarms** with different steps.
     * E.g., if CPU > 70% → add 1 instance; if CPU > 90% → add 2.
     * Exam keyword: *multiple thresholds / scaling in steps*.
   * **Simple Scaling (Legacy)**

     * Add/remove a fixed number when alarm triggers.
     * Includes a **cooldown period** to prevent rapid scale-in/out.
     * Exam keyword: *legacy, cooldown*.

---

3. **Predictive Scaling**

   * Uses **machine learning** + past traffic to forecast demand.
   * Adjusts capacity *before* traffic spikes.
   * Exam keyword: *predict demand, forecast traffic*.

---

4. **Scheduled Scaling**

   * Scale at specific times.
   * Example: every weekday at 9 AM, add 3 instances.
   * Exam keyword: *time-based / predictable workload*.

---

5. **Lifecycle Hooks**

   * Pause instance transitions to run custom actions (install software, run scripts).
   * States: `Pending:Wait`, `Terminating:Wait`.
   * Exam keyword: *custom actions during scale-in/scale-out*.

---

6. **Cooldown Period**

   * Time to wait after scaling before another action.
   * Prevents flapping.
   * Exam keyword: *stabilization, prevent over-scaling*.

---

7. **Warm Pools**

   * Keep pre-initialized EC2 instances **“warm”** so scaling is faster.
   * Exam keyword: *fast scale-out, pre-initialized instances*.

---

# 🔹 Scaling Metrics (CloudWatch)

* **CPU Utilization**
* **Network In/Out**
* **Request count per target** (for ALB)
* **Custom metrics** (via CloudWatch PutMetricData)

Exam trick:
👉 "For ALB-based scaling, you should use **RequestCountPerTarget**, not CPU."

---

# 🔹 High-Yield Exam Keywords

* **Target Tracking = thermostat, recommended, simplest**
* **Step Scaling = thresholds, add/remove based on levels**
* **Simple Scaling = legacy, cooldown**
* **Predictive Scaling = forecast demand**
* **Scheduled Scaling = time-based**
* **Lifecycle Hooks = run scripts during transitions**
* **Warm Pools = reduce launch time**
* **ELB health checks = auto replace unhealthy instance**
* **Min / Max / Desired capacity = boundaries for ASG**
* **Cooldown = stabilization period**

---

# 🔹 Example Exam Traps

1. *"You want to maintain CPU around 40% without complex setup."*
   👉 **Target Tracking**

2. *"Scale out faster if CPU > 70%, and even faster if CPU > 90%."*
   👉 **Step Scaling**

3. *"Company knows traffic increases at 9 AM every day."*
   👉 **Scheduled Scaling**

4. *"Forecast next week’s Black Friday traffic spike."*
   👉 **Predictive Scaling**

5. *"Run a custom script before terminating an instance."*
   👉 **Lifecycle Hook**
